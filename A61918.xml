         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N purſuance of what I not long ſince intimated in the cloſe of the Epiſtle Dedicatory prefixed to my Practical Regiſter, and in hopes of as favourable an acceptance of this tender of my reſpectfull ſervice, as you then pleaſed to afford my weak endeavours, am I now encouraged to make this my ſecond
<pb facs="tcp:49377:3"/>humble adreſs. Though this be but a yonger brother, in reſpect of its time of production, yet in reference to its firſt conception, growth, &amp; parts, I may juſtly ſay, it far excels the elder birth, and is much more fit to do your Honour, and the Publique, ſervice, and may be (I conceive) capable of as large, if not of a greater meaſure of your favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. I will not be troubleſome to you in relating the pains &amp; time I have taken and ſpent in this Collection and Publication, but ſhal leave it to your judicious conſideration. How great ſoever they have been I repent me not, but am (in my ſelf) abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, and do think it reward enough, that I have thereby gained this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſhew my continuing humble reſpects to your Honour, and my willingneſs to be ſome way ſerviceable to others, whatever I have been to my ſelf (in that Vocation God hath of his goodneſs been pleaſed to place me in) and to give an Accompt to the World (a thing which I hold every good Chriſtian is bound to do) of the expence of my time.</p>
            <p>It may be objected, that the Preſs hath been very fertile in this our Age, and hath brought forth many, if not too many births of this nature. I muſt confeſs this Truth; but how legitimate moſt of them are, let the Learned judge: This I am ſure of, there is not
<pb facs="tcp:49377:3"/>a father alive to own many of them, and they ſpeak ſo plain in the Language of <hi>Aſhdod,</hi>

I am not ſo blindly fond, or ſo opiniaſtre as to think it free from Errors and Miſpriſions, I fear there may too many be found in it, and no wonder, for <hi>Humanum est errare, labi, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi;</hi> yet this I do knowingly aver, that I have not (herein) <hi>ex propoſito</hi> or willingly injured any, but have been as ſtudious and carefull in the penning of this my Collection to do right to every perſon concerned, and to make the Truth appear clearly in its native colours, as was poſsible at a throngued Bar to do. Nor have I been leſs wanting in my beſt endeavours, to prevent and correct the Errors of the Preſs, (though I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge my pains and care are not herein fully anſwered) that it might appear in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,

            <p>FOr a more noble Epithite I know not how to give you (the greateſt &amp; beſt of men on earth being in truth no more.) Theſe enſuing Reports were at firſt briefly taken by me in the Law-french, without any thought of making other uſe of them, then for my one privat ſatisfaction, And they did for ſome time after lye ſo confuſedly ſcattered in my Note-books, that as they then lay, they were altogether uſeleſſe to any but my ſelf, and that not without much expence of time and great trouble, ſo that what of them my unhappy memory could not retain, (which was not much) was in a manner loſt as wel to my ſelf, as unto others; to remedy this inconvenience, (if I may ſo call it,) of the loſſe of my conſtant attendance, &amp; pains for ſo many years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether taken at the now upper Bench Bar, with very litle profit either to others or my ſelf, than ſome ſmall improvement of my knowledge in the practical part of the law, and in purſuance of that antient Moral Axiome, <hi>Omne agens agit propter aliquem ſinem,</hi> I was encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to continue my travail, and expence of time in the gathering together, tranſcribing, and putting of them into that order, and method you now behold them, yet as then not having any intent or deſire to make them publique, but only more readily uſefull to my ſelf, and ſuch of my Friends and Acquaintance as ſhould at any time deſire to be ſatisfied in any thing I was able to impart unto them. But this not anſwering the expectation, and importunities of ſome of my neer relations, and many of my intimate Friends and Acquaintance, nor knowing into whoſe hands my papers might fall, nor how my ſelf and others be injured in the publiſhing of them after my deceaſe, which I was uncertain when it might happen, and did believe it could not be many years off, by reaſon of my declining years; but more eſpecially in reſpect of the weak and craſy conſtitution of my Body much macerated by ſharp, and tedious ſickneſſes, and being willing to leave ſome teſtimony behind me, that I have not ſlighted, or wholy neglected my calling, but have ever had an honourable eſteem of it, though I have hitherto reaped but little of that benefit, which too too many do ſo eagerly hunt after, but have been doing ſomething therein, and have not lived altogether a drone for ſo many years together in ſo famous a Society amidſt ſo many learned men, to the diſhonour thereof, and to my one reproach; I did at laſt reſolve (notwithſtanding the unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cenſures, which I was confident I ſhould meet withal, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have, or could ſay to avoid them,) to give way to this publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:49377:5"/>of them, even in this age, wherein moſt of the Caſes, and matters herein reported are yet freſh (I ſuppoſe) in the memories of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who may eaſily trace me where ever I ſtep awry; But I hope to find them not only juſt in vindicating of me, in that which I have truely and faithfully reported, but alſo favourable in cenſuring, and paſſing by thoſe ſlips and miſpriſions they may herein meet withall, cauſed either by the Printers negligence, or my own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of the ſenſe of the matters, and things delivered and ſpoken unto, and the rather, in regard that I have endeavoured as neer as I could to render things in the ſame expreſſions they were firſt uttered, that ſo I might as much as might be, avoid the danger of injuring of any herein concerned, by putting another ſenſe upon them, than what they intended; and this as it was the old way, ſo I conceive what ever may be objected to the contrary, that it is the beſt, and cleereſt way of reporting. For thoſe, that make it their buſineſſe to cenſure, and not to read or underſtand books, I ſhall ſay nothing to them, but leave them to abound in their one ſenſe if they have any, and to pleaſe themſelves with their own phanſies. I have made theſe Reports ſpeak Engliſh, not that I believe they will be thereby generally more uſefull, for I have been always, and yet am of opinion, that that part of the Common Law which is in Engliſh hath only occaſioned the making of unquiet ſpirits conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly knowing, and more apt to offend others, than to defend themſelves; but I have done it in obedinece to authority, and to ſtop the mouths of ſuch of this Engliſh age, who though they be as confuſedly different in their Minds and Iudgements, as the builders of <hi>Babel</hi> were in their languages, yet do think it vain, if not impious to ſpeak or underſtand more than their own mother-tongue. Some may peradventure, Notwithſtanding the reaſons I have formerly offered for this my publication, be ready to object that it was vain, glory, and a too confident boldneſſe, and high conceipt of mine own abilities that makes me thus appear in publique; but thoſe that know me I believe are of another opinion, and dare clear me of this aſperſion, and well they may, for the truth is I have alwayes been, and yet am ſo naturally diſtruſtful of my own parts, that I fall far ſhort of that neceſſary boldneſſe which is requiſite for every man to be armed withall in the excerciſing of publique employments, and what loſſe I have ſuffered by the want of this, I my ſelf do beſt know, and is not unknown to many, ſome of whom have out of their well-wiſhes to me, and others to my diſparagement (as they thought) been pleaſed to take notice of it. If any of the Caſes and matters herein conteined ſeem common unto any, and are to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid to pleaſe their curious Palates, let them paſſe them over: It may be they may prove uſefull to others, and I doubt not but the moſt curious may find many things that may give them delight and ſatisfaction. And in the farther vindication of theſe Reports, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all to take notice, that firſt, theſe were moſt of them) taken in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled times, wherein the Law was almoſt at a ſtand, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:49377:5"/>it cannot be reaſonably expected they ſhould be ſo quick and full of matter, as thoſe that have been gathered when the Laws flowed in a more open, and uninterrupted Chanell, when the Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice were full fraught with buſineſſe, and were in a more ſplendent and flouriſhing condition than in theſe latter times; and next, that this work is not a collection only of ſome choice Caſes taken by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hands in all the Courts of <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> but is only a continued narrative of the Caſes, and proceedings of the new upper Bench Court for 10 years together, and taken by one only hand, without the help or aſſiſtance of any other, during which time I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but little, ſaving when by reaſon of ſickneſſe, I was for a Term or two conſtrained to be abſent. And the more to encourage all to the peruſall of them, I dare affirm that there is much various matter contained in them, &amp; different from what is to be found in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reports taken in former years, occaſioned by the many altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the face of things, and the changes of government happing at this time, and alſo by reaſon of my conſtant obſerving, inſerting, and interweaving of all the remarkable paſſages tranſacted on the Criminal ſide, with thoſe hapning on the Pleas ſide, which in other Reports hath very ſparingly at any time, if at all been perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I have alſo for the Readers greater eaſe and benefit, added hereunto three Alphabetical Tables, the firſt containing the names of the ſeveral Caſes; a ſecond containing the ſeveral general Heads, or Titles under which the ſeveral matters diſperſed through the whole book, are properly digeſted; and the third, and laſt, being a large Table particularly directing to the Page and Caſe, wherein you may find the ſubject matter methodically ranged under thoſe Heads or Titles. And for your further and fuller ſatisfaction, and making the Caſes the cleerer proof, and more authentical authority to be cited and given credit unto, you have the number Rolles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ixed to moſt of thoſe that are remarkable amongſt them. I might, and would if I had thought it neceſſary have much enlarged theſe Reports, and made the volume ſwell to a far greater bulk: But my aim and endeavours have generally been to take the chief points only, and ſubſtance of the matters ariſing and ſpoken unto, and the rational parts of the arguments and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities uſed and urged, to inforce and prove what was ſurmiſed to be Law on either ſide, and the grounds and authorities upon which the opinions and reſolutions of the Court are framed and given, and to paſſe by all the luxuriant flouriſhes of wit, and the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Similary Caſes to the Caſes in queſtion, as ſerving more for the moſt part to prove the curious phanſy, &amp; much reading of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer, than the proof of the points of the caſes in queſtion, or the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or information of the Auditors or Readers Iudgment; and I have ever (yet with ſubmiſſion to better Iudgements,) conceived this conciſe way of taking Reports to be farr more beneficial and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, not only to the Reporter, but alſo to thoſe that ſhall read
<pb facs="tcp:49377:6"/>them, then that long and tedious way, wherein the truth is ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with multiplicity of words, that it is very difficult through thoſe Clowds to diſcover, and behold her perfect beauty ſo well, as when ſhe appears bare-faced in her true and natural complexion. I need not ſay any thing in commendation of the Common Laws, they do ſo ſufficiently, and clearly ſpeak their own worth, not only in our own land, but even through the Chriſtian, if I may not ſay the whole known world. The fruit that every one from him that ſits on the Throne, to her that grindeth at the Mill, throughout this nation in the tender preſervation of our Religion, Lives, Liberties, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties do lowdly proclaim their excellency, and do juſtly claim our reverent eſteem of them, and their ſweet influence which our Neighbour Nations do partake of from their light and heat, hath purchaſed an honourable name, and repute amongſt them. Though no doubt but other Kingdomes, and Republiques have many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent written and eſtabliſhed Laws ſutable to the particular conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the people, and to their ſeveral frames of government, and amongſt the reſt the Civil or imperial Laws, yet they all want many remarkable excellencies that are in the Common Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and the proceedings therein, and amongſt the reſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in no more, they are very deficient in this way uſed in our Law for many ages paſt, of reporting, and leaving to poſterity the learned arguments of councel at the Bar, and of the grave and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſolutions of the reverend Iudges in the deciſion of Caſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, and controverted amongſt us; and this way how ſightly ſoever it be now eſteemed of by many amongſt us, yet is by Strangers much valued, and was heretofore ſo much ſet by amongſt us, and thought ſo highly advantageous to the publique, that the wiſdome of this State did then think fit to appoint grave and judicious men, encouraged by an annual ſtipend, to attend and perform this task, and therefore I hope that he who hath undertaken this hard labour freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily in relation to the publique good, without hope of reward, is ſo far from deſerving blame and reproof, that he is rather to be cheriſhed and countenanced in theſe his endeavours by thoſe in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not to be raſhly and uncharitably calumnicated, or cenſured by any, but to be favourably interpreted, and received as one that makes it his aim to be accompted a true lover of the Common Laws, and really honoureth the profeſſion, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thereof.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Action upon the caſe.</note> for procuring a Commiſsion of Bankrupt againſt him, by virtue whereof he broke open his Shop, and took away his goods and Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books, whereby he was ſo diſcreited that he loſt his trade, to his damage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this the Defendant pleads, that the Plaintiff did heretofore bring his Action of treſpaſs for the breaking open of his Shop, and for the taking away of his goods, and had in that Action recovered dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt him, and demands if he ſhall not be thereby barred in this Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; And that he ſhould be barred the Defendants Councell alleged, that a recovery in one perſonal Action is a bar in all perſonal Actions touching the ſame thing, and that here the Action of treſpaſs formerly brought, and the Action of the caſe now brought were perſonal Actions, and that they were both brought for the ſame thing, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to be barred; It was alſo urged that an Action of the caſe lies not in this caſe, for that, to ground an Action upon the caſe, there muſt appear to be malice in the party that did the fact, and prejudice to the party to whom the fact is done, but there appears no malice here, for what was done is ſaid to be done, by virtue of a Commiſsion of Bankrupt which ſhall be intended a lawfull authority to warrant the fact, and not grounded upon malice, ſo that malice and prejudice do not both appear, but only damage, and that alone will not ſupport this Action, for neither for damage alone without malice, nor for malice without damage will an Action upon the caſe lie. But to this it was anſwered (to which the Court enelined) That this Action upon the caſe was not brought for the ſame cauſe that the Action of treſpaſs was formerly brought, for that was only for the breaking open of the Shop, and taking away his goods, and the damages he received thereby, but this Action is brought for the damage he ſuſtained, by the loſſe of his credit, and hindrance in his trade thereby, cauſed by the Defendants taking out a Commiſsion of Bankrupt againſt him, and by colour thereof breaking open his Shop and taking away his goods, and ſo diſparaging him in his reputation, whereby he loſt his trade; and though the breaking open of his Shop, and the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his goods be named in this Action, as it was in the former Action of treſpaſs,<note place="margin">Inducement.</note> yet it is but by way of Inducement to this Action upon his caſe, and not to recover damages for that wrong,<note place="margin">Actions ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> and here being two ſeverall wrongs done to the Plaintiff which do not one depend upon another, the Plaintiff muſt bring two ſeverall Actions for them, and not joyn them in one Action, becauſe the damages muſt be ſeveral which are to be recovered,<note place="margin">Ioynt Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> but if they had depended one upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother he might have joyned them in one Action, and recovered joynt dammages for both:<note place="margin">Ioynt dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> and beſides theſe two Actions differ in their nature one from the other, and the judgements given in them are ſeveral, for the Iudgement in an Action of Treſpaſs <hi>vi et Armis,</hi> as the firſt Action was, <hi>is Capiatur,</hi> becauſe there is thereupon a fine due to the King, but the Iudgement in an Action upon the caſe is <hi>ideo in miſericordia,</hi> and ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49377:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>though the Plaintiff have Iudgement here in his Action upon the caſe, it cannot be ſaid he hath had Iudgement already; for that muſt beintended, at leaſt a Iudgement of the ſame nature, which cannot be in this caſe. And to that which is objected, that if the Plaintiff ſhould recover damages in this Action, he ſhould recover damages twice for one and the ſame thing which is againſt Law; it is anſwered, that it is not for the ſame thing but cleerly for another, and if he ſhould not have this Action he were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy for the damage he ſuffred in the loſſe of his Credit, and the damage in his Trade; for in the former Action he recovered no damages for that, for the Iury never took that into their conſideration, for they had no power to take any damages into their conſideration which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened after the Treſpaſs done, for which the Action was brought, but only for the breaking open of the Shop, and the taking away of his Goods; and although he might at the firſt have brought his Action upon the caſe as he hath now done, yet he was not commpellable thereto, but had his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring either an Action upon his caſe, or an Action of Treſpaſs as ſhould moſt make for his advantage,<note place="margin">Election of Actions</note> for this Election of Action belongs to every ſubject as his birth right, and he is not to be hindred from it. <hi>Adjournatur.</hi>

The caſe was argued againſt the Kings Title, by <hi>Mountague</hi> of the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> and for the Kings title, by <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Lincolnes Inn.</hi> The ſubſtance of <hi>Mountagues</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was, <hi>1.</hi> To conſider the nature of the truſt; <hi>2.</hi> The nature of the land out of which the truſt was raiſed: and for the firſt he held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49377:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>it was a truſt for an Alien to take the profits of the land, and in that the Alien had no eſtate in the land; therefore the King could not have it, as he might have had the land if the Alien had had any Eſtate in it: and he ſaid that this truſt was a thing only in Action, and lies in privity, and not to be ſeiſed upon by another; and ſaid a Villein was a parallel Perſon in law to an Alien, in reſpect of purchaſing of lands, and had a Copihold been ſurrendred thus in truſt for a Villein, the Lord ſhould not have ſeiſed it; and this is but a truſt not Executed, which is in the nature of a uſe at the Common law, and not as it is now by the Statute: beſides, this truſt is raiſed out of Copyhold lands, and therefore the King cannot ſeiſe the lands which the Alien hath not, for if he ſhould, the Lord of whom the land is held, would be preiudiced; and he cited <hi>Beverlyes</hi> caſe <hi>4. rep. 126,</hi> and a caſe in <hi>23 Eliz: Hales</hi> on the other ſide Argued, that the King ſhall have the truſt, and laid theſe two grounds. <hi>1.</hi> That there may be a truſt raiſed upon the ſurrender of a Copyhold; and 2ly. that the ſurrender ſettles the truſt in the Alien, and cited <hi>11 H. 4.26.</hi> and he ſaid theſe things were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, <hi>1.</hi> Whether the King ſhall have any thing, and what he ſhall have; <hi>2.</hi> Whether he ſhall have a uſe for an Alien at the Common law, or a truſt; <hi>3.</hi> Whether he ſhall have a truſt raiſed out of a uſe. And for the firſt, he ſaid, that the truſt was not a thing meerly in Action, but an hereditament; and partly in poſſeſsion. and cited <hi>Cooks</hi> Inſtitutes <hi>469.</hi> and ſaid, the reaſon why an Alien may not purchaſe lands is, becauſe that this Kingdom might not be impoveriſhed thereby, by tranſporting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the land into a forein Country, and putting a part of it under the ſubjection of a forein Prince, and the ſame reaſon comes to the caſe in queſtion, and therefore is not to be ſuffered; and every Alien that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth is ſaid to purchaſe to the uſe of the King, and ſo ſhall it be in this caſe, and although a thing meerly in Action is not transferable to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, yet is it transferrable to the King: but this caſe is ſtronger for the King, for here is not a thing meerly in Action but mixed with an intereſt, and it is no reaſon, but that the law which was made to meet with the ſubtility of ſuch Alien purchaſors, ſhould take place here; and it cannot be ſaid that that law was made to give remedy to the King for that he had before, and a Feoffment now made in truſt for an Alien is all one with a uſe at the Common law; and he cited <hi>19. Jac.</hi> that truſts made to St. <hi>Iohn Daccombe</hi> of Annuityes for the Lord <hi>Summerſett</hi> attainted of Treaſon were adjudged to be forfeited: and he held,<note place="margin">Daccombe.</note> that there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a truſt raiſed out of a Copyhold and other lands, and if he hath an intereſt here in the profits, the ſeiſure is good, though he have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the land, for the land may be ſeiſed by the profits; <hi>5 H. 5. fol. 9.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Title.</note> But <hi>Rolle Iuſtice</hi> demanded of <hi>Hales,</hi> how the King ſhall be intitled to the profits of the land, where he is not intitled to the land it ſelf? and ſaid, that the Chancery cannot compell one to Execute a truſt for an Alien,<note place="margin">Chancery.</note> and that a truſt was invented only to avoid the Statute of uſes, and ſaid, that a truſt is not a thing in Action,<note place="margin">Truſt.</note> but may be an inheritance or a Chatell as the caſe falls out.

The Recorder of Councell with the City deſired time to amend the Retorn in matter of form only. And ſaid, that the Plaintiff was removed from his place by a Court of Record, and therefore hoped he ſhould not be this way reſtored, and that he had no loſs by being removed, and therefore the Caſe was the leſs conſiderable; and whereas it was objected againſt his amending of the Reton, that it was filed, &amp; ſo too late to move for it, He ſaid, that it was not filed by order of Court, but only ordered that Copies might be taken of it for Council to peruſe, and if ſo then it is not too late to pray it may be amended, but though it were filed he conceived that in a caſe of this importance it might be amended in matter of form as ſome Reforms had been formerly in this Court. <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> anſwered the Recorder to this effect, You ought to ſhew ſome cauſe upon which the party may have reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by a Writ of Error, or otherwiſe,<note place="margin">Return.</note> if Iudgement be wrongfully given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, which you have not done; and as to the filing of the Retorn,<note place="margin">Filing.</note> a Retorn may be filed either upon motion of the party, or by the rules of the Court, and it were good, you conſider how this was filed; and as touching the ſuſpenſion of the party from his place,<note place="margin">Suſpenſion.</note> it ought not to be perpetual but for a time only, and ſaid, that after filing of a Retorn, be it upon motion or by the rules of the Court, it cannot be amended. <hi>Tueſday next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was given by the Court to hear Councel on both parts.</hi>

                  <hi>Bacon Iuſtice</hi> much to the ſame effect, but differ'd in this, that there ought not to be a <hi>Venire facias de novo</hi> but ſaid, that Iudgement ought to be given againſt one party, to wit the Defendant, for ill joyning in Demurrer, to the intent the party that is not in fault may be diſmiſſed, and the parties here have waived the Tryal <hi>per pays</hi> by joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Demurrer.

               <p>THe Court was again moved in the Caſe between the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Eſtwick,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Argument concerning the Writ of Reſtitution to a common-Councel-mans place. Amendment.</note> that the return of the City might be amended although it were filed, becauſe there are Preſidents where it hath been done. <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, there was never any amended after the filing before <hi>H.</hi> 7ths. time. It was replyed by the Councel, that the return being of this Term it might be amended, for it reſted in the breaſt of the Iudges. But <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> anſwered to this, that Acts of the Court remain in the breaſt of the Court the ſame Term, but not acts of others, and therfore this being ſo was not amendable, and ſaid, that inferiour Courts cannot amend a preſentment in matter of fact, for that were to alter the cuſtom of the courts; and it was then ſaid, that Endictments had been amended after the filing of them. And Alderman <hi>Langhams</hi> Caſe was alſo urged, where a retorn of the City was amended after it was filed, yet this was ruled not amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. <hi>Twiſden of</hi> Councel with the City argued that <hi>Eſtwick</hi> ought not to be reſtored to his place of a Common-Councel-man for theſe reaſons. <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe it was not a place of profit, and ſo it was no damage to him to be removed, and therefore his ſute was to no purpoſe. 2ly. It is not a place of Government, and ſo no dignity in it, but it was a place meerly of ſervice and trouble. But <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, that a writ of reſtitution had been adjudged good to reſtore a Conſtable to his place,<note place="margin">Reſtitution.</note> which was more a place of ſervice and trouble than this. 3ly. There is a judgement againſt <hi>Eſtwick</hi> in a Court of Record, and it muſt be avoided either by error or attaint, as the Statute directs, and the partie cannot be reſtored by a Writ of Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for the objection, that the Return is too general, he anſwered, that Faith is to be given, that there was a diſturbance made by him as is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, though it be not ſo plainly expreſſed as it might have been. 2ly. Here appears a contempt to the Court, and for this he may be ſuſpended. 3ly. The Cuſtome is well purſued upon the whole matter taken together. 4ly. The Cuſtome is well laid for the commitment <hi>ad placitum,</hi> for it refers to the words <hi>ſuſpendere vel amovere,</hi> that is, either one or the other. 5ly. The word require amounts to a command being ſpoken in a Court of Record, and the diſobeying it was a contempt. <hi>Hales</hi> of Council on the ſame ſide argued much as <hi>Twiſden</hi> had done, and added to it as followeh. <hi>1.</hi> That there appears a reaſoanble cauſe precedent why he ſhould be ſuſpended, and then it follows they may ſuſpend him <hi>ad libitum.</hi> 2ly. The alleging of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance is not material, for that is not the ground of his a motion from his place, but only the inducement to it. 3ly. <hi>Requiſitus</hi> ſhall be underſtood <hi>requiſitus per curiam,</hi> it being alleged to be in Court. 4ly. <hi>Recuſavit</hi> is more than <hi>denegavit,</hi> and implies he did not the thing enjoyned him, and ſo might well be committed. 5ly. There may be cauſe to grant a Writ of reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though no cauſe for the reſtitution: For a common-Councel-man of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry</hi> had a Writ of reſtitution out of this Court, and yet upon his ſute was not reſtored. The Recorder moved for a longer day to be heard for the City, becauſe it was a weighty cauſe, and ſaid that no reſtitution could be made, for the Writ was not well directed, and ſo is not well executed. The Plaintiffs Councel deſired expedition in the Cauſe; Whereupon <hi>Roll</hi> ſaid, here hath been no delay in the buſineſs, but the rule is againſt you, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49377:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>he took theſe exceptions to the Retorn. <hi>1.</hi> It appears not by the retorn that the Plaintiff is removed from his place, but only that he is ſuſpended, and then he may well be reſtored, and it is not ſaid for how long time he is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. 2ly. It is not ſaid that he is ſuſpended for a reaſonable cauſe. 3ly. It is not ſaid what the diſturbance was that he made for which he is ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And further ſaid, that the Court of the Common-Councel is not a Court of Record,<note place="margin">Error. Reſtitution.</note> for no Writ of Error lies there, but is a Court only of Adviſe. <hi>Bacon Iuſtice</hi> as <hi>Roll,</hi> and ſaid, that <hi>Eſtwick</hi> had only remedy to be reſtored by a Writ of Reſtitution, and not by a Writ of Error or an Attaint.

               <p>THe Caſe of <hi>Eſtwick</hi> and the <hi>City of London</hi> was again argued by <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Glynn</hi> for the <hi>City;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Argument in the Caſe of the VVrit of Reſtitution to a Common-Councel-mans place. Reſtitution. Cuſtome.</note> in his Argument he inſiſted upon three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars why <hi>Eſtwick</hi> could not be reſtored to his place of a common-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-man. <hi>1.</hi> That a common-Councel-man may be removed or ſuſpended from his place at pleaſure by the cuſtome of the City. 2ly. That he cannot be reſtored by Law. 3ly. No reſtitution can be in this caſe as it now ſtands. Firſt, the cuſtom to remove a common-Councel-man is good, for it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by agreement, and ſuch a cuſtome is good at the common law, much more here, and it is not an unreaſonable cuſtome, although it may ſeem ſo <hi>prima facie,</hi> like as it is in the caſe of a Lord that feiſeth the Lands of his Villein, and in the caſe of a Copyholder that for feiteth his Eſtate by the felling of Timber. A ſecond reaſon is, it agrees well with the nature and condition of the office of a common-Councel-man to be ſubject to this Cuſtome,<note place="margin">Tryal.</note> and we know that many things ſhall be tryed by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, contrary to the courſe of the common law. 3ly. We ſee that the order of the Parliament is a rule to try matters concerning their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſo it is here in the Citie to try their Members. 4ly. If it ſhould not be ſo, it would prove deſtructive to the City, by waiting till ſuch an offender might be removed by a courſe in Law, which is far more tedious than this cuſtomary way. To the ſecond point, he ſaid, that by Law there can be no reſtitution to this office, and this is proved by the very nature of the Writ of Reſtitution, which is to reſtore the party to a freehold or ſome other matter of profit, neither of which can be in our caſe, and a writ of Reſtitution is to reſtore one to a poſſeſsion, where one may not be reſtored by an ordinary way, neither doth the Statute of <hi>Magna char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> extend to our caſe: for a common-Councel-mans place is merely grounded upon the cuſtome of the City, and not upon the Common law: and he ſaid there are three grounds for a Writ of Reſtitution. <hi>1.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to the King. 2ly. A hurt to the Common-wealth. 3ly. Particular dammage to the party; but none of theſe is in our cauſe, and therefore there is no cauſe for a Writ of Reſtitution. The caſe of Sir <hi>Iames Baggs</hi> having a Writ of Reſtitution was, becauſe he was deprived of his Trade and Freedom,<note place="margin">Conſtable. Church war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden.</note> &amp; free-hold, and our caſe differs from the caſe of a Conſtable, or a Church warden, or any caſe that can be cited; for a Church warden is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer in relation to the Common wealth for the execution of Iuſtice, wherof the Common law takes notice, and likewiſe a Conſtable is a known Officer to miniſter Iuſtice in relation to the publique:<note place="margin">Recorder.</note> ſo is it of a Recorder of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſo they all differ from our caſe. For authority to this point in <hi>17. Iac.</hi> but moved firſt <hi>16 Iac. Warren</hi> a common-Councel-man of <hi>Coventry</hi> was denyed upon the retorn of his Writ to be reſtored, and our caſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torn is more ſtrong againſt the Plaintiff; and <hi>Burman</hi> a Gentleman of one of the Inne of Court, being expelled, could not be reſtored by a Writ of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and lately a common-Councel-man was removed for not taking the Proteſtation. For the third point, whether upon the Writ it ſelf, as this caſe is, there can be any reſtitution made? I conceive not, becauſe it is directed to the Maior and Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and ſo there is in it a falſe recital of the ſuſpenſion;<note place="margin">Recital.</note> for he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by the Citizens, and ſo the Writ is directed to parties who did not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49377:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>the wrong, and ſo it is ill directed, and it differs from the direction of the Writ in Sir <hi>James Bags</hi> caſe, and it ought to have been directed to the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs or Miniſters who have authority to reſtore him, as they did remove him, for the party that hath done no wrong ought not to be puniſhed or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted; and for the ill direction of the Writ could not <hi>Warren</hi> the common-Councel-man of <hi>Coventry</hi> he reſtored, and the Corporation of <hi>London</hi> is reſponſable for all particular Miſdemeanours done within any Courts of Iuſtice within the City, or other general Miſdemeanours there committed.<note place="margin">Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note>
                  <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide argued, that the caſe was miſtaken as it is ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Retorn, for it ſuppoſeth that the party is removed at pleaſure, and yet ſuppoſeth alſo, that there is a cauſe to remove him, to wit his refuſing to go out, and expreſſeth not that he did not go out, nor that he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go out, but that he was requeſted. And whereas it is more than to adviſe, for he hath a privilege for his own good, and the good of the City. 3ly. The Writ is well directed, and cannot be otherwiſe for the party to have remedy, and all the Preſidents are as this is,<note place="margin">Preſidents.</note> and Alderman <hi>Harris</hi> his caſe is the ſame in point with this, where it was by three Iudges reſolved, that he ſhould be reſtored to his Aldermans place, becauſe it was a place of Honour as well as of Burthen. <hi>Roll Juſtice</hi> ſaid, <hi>1.</hi> That the Writ was well directed. 2ly. That the cuſtom was ill recited, 3ly, If it were well recited, yet it is a void cuſtom. 4ly. The Retorn is not good, for the incertainties of it, <hi>viz.</hi> in the cauſes ſhewed, why the party was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and therefore that he ought to be reſtored to his place. <hi>Bacon Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> to the ſame intent, and ſaid, that whereſoever a Commiſsioner or other perſon hath power given to do a thing at his diſcretion, it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of ſound diſcretion, and according to Law,<note place="margin">Diſcretion.

The Queſtion here is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the adminiſtration of the Goods, before the Covenant broken, be good after it is broken, and there is good matter before the Court found in the ſpecial verdict, though it might have been found better. The firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I will draw from the nature of that, upon which the Action is founded, namely, the Covenant. The Action depends partly upon the Déed of Covenant partly upon the breach of it, and here is no ground of Action at the time when the adminiſtration of the Goods was made; and <hi>Hariſons</hi> caſe cannot be avoided: for a Statute is a preſent duty,<note place="margin">Duty. Star. Obligation.</note> and ought to be paid before an Obligation. <hi>Robſons</hi> caſe <hi>14. &amp; 15 Iac.</hi> And it is as agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Law, to pay a Legacy as a Debt upon a Covenant; and the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the Leſſee in our caſe is not ſo material, as the miſchief may be on the Executors part, &amp; it is not materially objected, that he might take ſecurity,<note place="margin">Security.</note> for he cannot compel it. For the Objection that our Law takes notice of a Legacy, I anſwer, that the Law takes notice of a Legacy, as to give an intereſt in it to the Legatee,<note place="margin">Intereſt.</note> although he may not take it without the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors conſent. 2ly. It takes notice of it as remediable by the Law of the Kingdom, though not by the Common-law: and therefore conſider the Statute <hi>21 H. 8.</hi> of Adminiſtrations;<note place="margin">Common law, Civil law.</note> and the Common-law is Iudge of the Statute, concerning Adminiſtration, and not the Spiritual-law, <hi>Hill. 17 Iac. Hinſon &amp; Buttons Caſe.</hi> The Common-law gives not a remedy fora Legacy,<note place="margin">Legacy.</note> but the Spiritual-Court is ſupported by the Common-law to do it: and by the antient Common-law there was remedy to recover a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>2 Rich. 3. f. 14. Glanv. lib 7. C. 6.7.</hi> and the power of the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Court is derived from the Common-law, and the Common-law will take notice of a compulſary way in the Eccleſiaſtical-Court to pay a Legacy. And the payment in our caſe is executed, and now the Law takes notice of it, becauſe the Defendant was compellable to it.<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hales,</hi> the word <hi>Quarry</hi> is a good word, &amp; well-known what it means: for <hi>Quarrera</hi> is an old wel-known Latine word for it,<note place="margin">Dower.</note> and ſhe is as well dowable of it as of a Mine of Coles, and it ſhall be intended to be open, becauſe ſhe demands it by that name of a <hi>Quarry. Holhead,</hi> The demand of the Dower is alſo of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, of which a Woman is not dowable, becauſe it is an entire thing, and cannot be divided, and the demand ſhould have been <hi>de tertia parte proficu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum hundredi.</hi> To this <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, then by your reaſon ſhe ſhall never keep a Court. <hi>Hales,</hi> It is well enough demanded, for a demand ſhall be of the thing it ſelf, and not of the profits of it, for the profits were not in the Husband, but he was ſeiſed of the Hundred, and the profits are a thing incertain. <hi>Holhead,</hi> The execution of the <hi>Habere facias feſinam</hi> is not well executed, for by it two third parts are aſsigned for Dower, and that is more than the demand. <hi>Hales,</hi> That is but a repetition of the thing demanded. <hi>Holhead,</hi> A thing not demanded at all is aſsigned for Dower, <hi>viz.</hi> view of Frank pledge. <hi>Hales,</hi> That is but an incident to another thing that is demanded, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hundred, and by the demand of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the view of Frank-pledge is demanded, and all other incidents to the Hundred. <hi>Holhead</hi> Here is an aſsignment alſo of all tenures, and ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have Homage, becauſe ſhe is a Woman. <hi>Hales,</hi> She ſhall have all te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures

And there is error in the aſsignment of dammages: for the dammages are aſsigned <hi>ultra valorem terrae,</hi> which is againſt the Statute. <hi>Roll Iuſtice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dammages. Iudgement.</note> the Statute is an addition of the value and dammages, for the Iudgement is perfect without returning the Writ of the dammages, and ſo hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in the Common pleas. <hi>Holhead,</hi> Here is an ill ſuggeſtion of the Feme, for the ſuggeſteth, that her Husband dyed ſeiſed in fee of all the Lands out of which ſhe demands her Dower, and that is not true, for he dyed ſeiſed of part of them in tayl. To this the Court ſaid, that is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial if he dyed ſo ſeiſed, that ſhe ought to have Dower. <hi>Holhead,</hi> Dammages are given <hi>ultra valorem,</hi> which I conceive is not good. <hi>Roll Iuſtice,</hi> It is well enough: for dammages are given, and the value by the Statute. <hi>Holhead,</hi> The retorn of the <hi>Elegit</hi> is not good. <hi>Hales,</hi> That is another Record, and appears not now in the Court. <hi>Roll Iuſtice,</hi> The <hi>Elegit</hi> hath no reference to the former Record. <hi>Holhead,</hi> There is one error in fact, and that is confeſſed by your joyning in demurrer.<note place="margin">Doubleneſs.</note> 
                  <hi>Roll Iuſtice,</hi> You might have demurred for this doubleneſs, for one cannot aſsign an error in fact, and another error in Law in a Writ of Error, for this is double. <hi>Hales,</hi> It is true, but we have loſt that advantage. <hi>Adjourned to be argued again the next Term.</hi>

By the verdict it was taken for a free Chapel, and that it was ſeiſed into the Kings hands.

It may be preſentative, and yet a free Chapel according to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and endowment of it, and a free Chapel, may become a Church by preſentation of the Patron, but it appears not to be ſo to us. The proviſo of the Statute ſhews that it was not the intent of the Statute, to exempt all free Chapels, but thoſe only which are named, and no more: And the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Statute was that the King ſhall have it as a lay thing, and he was not compelled to preſent, and here the Patron hath taken the profits, and there are no inhabitants within the Pariſh, for the ſeignory compriſeth all the pariſh, and if the King preſents by lapſe where he ought to do it <hi>ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no jure,</hi> the preſentation is not good.

Another queſtion is, whether the Iury have found the Award ſet forth in the replication, or whether they have found any Award at all, ad if any Award be found, it is ſuch an Award which is not in iſſue in the replication, and ſo the verdict is for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. And as to the Award it ſelf, I hold it void, for the parties have not ſubmitted to the Award that is made, for there is no ſubmiſsion to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of matters ariſing between the time of the ſealing of one Bond, and of the other Bond, and ſo the Arbitrators have exceeded the ſubmiſsion, for they have awarded to make releaſes at the ſealing of the laſt Bond, which compriſeth all the time between the ſealing of one Bond, and of the other. Next, part of the Award is not good by exceeding the ſubmiſsion, and this makes all the Award naught, for all the parts of this Award do ſo depend one upon another, that if one be naught all is naught. And the laſt part of the Award is naught, and ſo the Award is made but on the one part (which cannot be good,) for if the releaſe be not made, all Actions between the parties cannot ceaſe according to the Award, and ſo the Award is not final; And there is no verdict here for the Plaintiff, although the verdict ſhould not be for the Defendant, for it appears not whether the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> be before or after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and ſo prayes Iudgement for the Defendant. <hi>Roll Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, if there appears a material variance between the Award <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if this were not a reciprocal Covenant the Law would be otherwiſe, and cited <hi>Hayes and Hayes Caſe 11 Car. and Skippon and Lucas his caſe 10 Car.</hi> But <hi>Bacon Iuſtice</hi> held the contrary that the demurrer was good, for that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that it was the intent of both partyes that the Plaintiff ſhould firſt repair, and after that the Defendant ſhould keep the houſes in repair. <hi>The Court would adviſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Latch</hi> of Councel with the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant argued That it was not forfeited; <hi>1.</hi> Becauſe that the Ordinance is penal, and retroſpective or looking back; and therefore it is odious in Law, and ſhall not be largely interpreted but as ſtrictly as may be. 2ly, The preamble of the Ordinance ſets forth <hi>2.</hi> things, as the reaſons why the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance was made; <hi>1.</hi> Mr. <hi>Pyms</hi> deſerts, to whom the lands were given; 2ly, <hi>Morgans</hi> offences, for which he was thus puniſhed: and both theſe grounds for making the Ordinance can extend no further than to the year <hi>1641.</hi> and ſo not to the time of the ſettlement made <hi>13 Car.</hi> by Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Morgan;</hi> for then neither of theſe cauſes alleged were in being; 2ly, The purview of the Ordinance is double; <hi>1.</hi> punitive: 2ly, remunerative. <hi>1.</hi> the punitive part, which concerns the puniſhing of Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan:</hi> 2ly, the remunerative part, concerning the rewarding of Mr. <hi>Pym;</hi> and the punitiue part made in the year <hi>1645.</hi> cannot reach the eſtate ſetled upon <hi>Mary</hi> his daughter ſo long before, <hi>viz. 13 Car.</hi> for it can reach no further back than to the year <hi>1641.</hi> at the moſt to which time, and no further, the Ordinance is retroſpective: and in the Statute of <hi>23 H. 8.</hi> general words of an Act are reſtrained. Beſides, there is a demonſtration in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that ſhews the Ordinance doth not extend to the eſtate of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as may appear by the proviſoes conteined in it; for although the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Morgan</hi> are to be puniſhed within the Ordinance by the ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo of it, yet this extends not to ſo long time as to <hi>13 Car.</hi> when the eſtate was ſetled, but only to the eſtate, as it was in the year <hi>1641.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:49377:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>prayed Iudgement for the Defendant. <hi>Wadham Windham</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide argued, that the eſtate of <hi>Morgan,</hi> though it was ſaid to be ſetled <hi>13 Car.</hi> was forſeited by the Ordinance. Becauſe the eſtate was not abſolutely ſetled at that time, for there was a proviſo in the conveyance to revoke the ſettlement, ſo that at the time of the Ordinance made the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate was in Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> abſolutely to diſpoſe off as he pleaſed, and by the words of the Ordinance all <hi>Morgans</hi> eſtate is paſſed without any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and the proviſoes of the Ordinance do prove, that the Children of Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> were excepted out of the ſavings made to preſerve the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of others. Alſo Boons and Favours beſtowed uſe to be amply ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and this being a Boon beſtowed by the Parliament ſhall receive as large a conſtruction as is poſsible. Beſides <hi>Morgan</hi> was a Papiſt, &amp; therfore it may well be ſuppoſed, that he intended not this for any real ſettlement, but only by way of ſubtility for ſome private reaſons: for we know that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do uſe to make ſuch ſettlements as this was to preſerve them from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the Law. And the words of the Ordinance are accumulative to convey all <hi>Morgans</hi> eſtate, and there are no reſtrictive words, and if there were they ſhould be void here: for the Manor of <hi>Callidown,</hi> being the Lands in queſtion are expreſly given by the Ordinance, and as to theſe Lands the rights of all men are bound, and therefore if there were a ſaving it would be void, as it is <hi>Cook rep.

And an act of Parliament ſometimes is as a conveyance, ſometime as a judgment, and both waies a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in it is void and ſrivolous, <hi>1 Rep. 4.</hi> A conditional eſtate or a right may be ſaved by Iudgment or fine, but not an entire eſtate or intereſt,<note place="margin">Saving.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eſtate of <hi>Mary</hi> in the Manor of <hi>Callidown,</hi> cannot be ſaved by any proviſo, and he cited <hi>Alton Woods</hi> Caſe for authority in the principal Caſe, <hi>f. 51.</hi> But admitting a general ſaving had been good to ſave <hi>Maries</hi> eſtate, yet as the words of the Ordinance were penned, her eſtate is not ſaved by it, for the words were put in the Ordinance for the advantage of <hi>Pym,</hi> and not to provide for <hi>Mary:</hi> for ſhe claims from <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> and ſo pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iudgement for the Plaintif. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that the proviſoes in the Ordinance are not void to all perſons, as <hi>Windham</hi> argued, for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are clearly provided for by them. <hi>But let the Caſe be argued again Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday fortnight.

               <p>AN order of Seſsions made for the ſetling of a poor woman in the pariſh of <hi>Hardingham</hi> was returned hither by a <hi>Certiorari</hi> granted to the ſaid pariſh,<note place="margin">For quaſhing an Order of Seſſions for the ſetling of a Vagrant.</note> and upon the return read, and opening the matter by Councel, the caſe was this. An inhabitant dwelling within the pariſh of <hi>Briſley,</hi> did hire a maid ſervant for a year, and Covenanted to give her Forty ſhillings for her wages, and entertained her into his ſervice. The maid ſervant ſome time after fell ſick in his ſervice; her Maſter thereupon turns her out of his ſervice, without giving her any thing: the maid, for neceſsity, in travelling from <hi>Briſley</hi> toward <hi>Hardingham</hi> where her friends lived, and where ſhe was born, was forced to beg for relief: whereupon ſhe was ſent as a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant to <hi>Hardingham,</hi> where ſhe was born. The Vill of <hi>Hardingham</hi> ſend her back to <hi>Briſley,</hi> where ſhe was entertained as a Covenant ſervant: whereupon they of <hi>Briſley</hi> procure an order of Seſsions to ſettle her at <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingham.</hi> The Queſtion was, Whether this were a good order, or not, for ſetling her at <hi>Hardingham</hi> according to the Statute?

Tithes are excepted, and the proceſs uſually before that directed to the Biſhop for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration, is not taken away by the Statute of <hi>5 Ed. 3.53. N.

Next the late Ordinance of Parliament hath made no alteration in this caſe; for the Ordinance intended not to puniſh the Parſons of Churches, although it doe out Biſhops of their Biſhopricks and dignities. And as to the Objection, That if the Tithes ſhould not be here extendible, there would be a failer of juſtice. I anſwer, That our caſe is out of the Common law, upon which, the rule, that extraordinary courſes are to be taken, rather than there ſhould be a failer of Iuſtice, is grounded. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that there are two Queſtions in this caſe, <hi>1.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tithes are within the Statute? 2ly, Whether now that Biſhops are taken away by the Parliament, the Sherifs may levy the debt of the Clergy as the Biſhops uſed to doe? and I conceive they may,<note place="margin">Levari.</note> by a <hi>levari facias.</hi> But the great queſtion is, Whether the <hi>Elegit</hi> lye?

                  <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide held, that the Cuſtome was well ſet forth for the general charge for the preſent neceſsity, and afterwards the particular Inhabitants charged ſhall have remedy againſt the other Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to make them contribute, as it was in Doctor <hi>Lambs</hi> Caſe, that was flain in an Vproar in <hi>London,</hi> where the City was fined generally, but the Citizens afterwards contributed to the payment of it: for all are lyable to the charge by the Common law, and it may be alſo by the preſcription.<note place="margin">10 Ed. 3. f. 8, 9.</note> The Court reproved the Councel, and ſaid, you ought not to argue two of you at one time on the ſame ſide, except it be upon concluſion of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Bar in the cauſe. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, the tax ought to be particular, but it is not to be laid upon the Townſhip, if there be not a Cuſtome for it, and ſuch a Cuſtome may be reaſonable, and it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to deſtroy it, for fear of the publique danger that may ariſe by doing it.<note place="margin">Retorn.</note> And for the retorn of the Commiſsioners it is not neceſſary it ſhould be ſo ſtrict as our pleadings are. The Court gave <hi>Twiſden</hi> time till that day ſeven night to be heard on the other ſide. At which time to the exception that was taken, that it appears not that <hi>Lynn Regis</hi> is within the limits of the Commiſsion by virtue of which the tax is made; It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it doth appear. To the ſecond exception taken, that here is a new Bank or Wall ordered to be made, and not the repairing the old, and this is not within the Commiſsion; It was anſwered, that the making of the new Bank is but to ſtrengthen the old Bank, and ſo is but a repairing of an old work, and not the making of of a new. 2ly. The Wall is to be made by conſent of all the Inhabitants intereſſed in the benefit, which may accrue by the making of it. As to the exception that it appeares not that <hi>Tyd</hi> and <hi>Newton</hi> are within the Hundred of <hi>Witsbitch,</hi> touching which only this Commiſsion of Sewers was granted; It was anſwered, that it ſhall be ſo intended, and it is alſo ſo found. To the exception, that the new Bank was made in another manner than the old Bank, and ſo it is a new work, and it appears not that the parties taxed have any benefit by it; It was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it doth not appear that the Drayners have done any thing for their own benefit in the making this Bank, nor were any cauſe of making the new Bank. To the exception that it is not preſented where the Bank is; It was anſwered, it is certain enough ſet forth in the Preſentment, and Preſentments are not required to be ſo preciſe as other pleadings are. To the exception that <hi>Tyd</hi> and <hi>Newton</hi> ought not to make the Bank becauſe other Towns uſe to do it; It was anſwered, that for making it in the new manner, the other Vills are not bound to make it alone, but thoſe alſo that receive the benefit by it. Theſe exceptions following were alſo taken to the laying of the Tax. <hi>1.</hi> That all the Lands within the Vills of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Tyd</hi> are not charged, but ſo many Acres in one, and ſo many in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. To this it was anſwered, that it doth not appear that there were more Acres than are taxed either in <hi>Tyd</hi> or <hi>Newton.</hi> 2ly. The high grounds and the low grounds are equally taxed, which is not indifferent: for ſome
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49377:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>acres are of a greater value than others are. To this it was anſwered, that for ought that doth appear they are of an equal value. 3ly. They ought not to ſell the diſtreſs taken, becauſe the Vills did not bring in the number of acres, by the Officer appointed by the Commiſsioners to doe it. It was anſwered, that they may ſell the goods, or allow a Replevin: And ſecondly here appears not to be any diſtreſs or impounding of the goods. <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Barnard</hi> on the other ſide: Firſt he ſaid, that all the exceptions are not opened, and the firſt exception is not anſwered; for it appears not by averment that the Vills taxed are within the extent of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, as it ought doe, <hi>2 H. 7. f. 13.</hi> Nor is the ſecond Exception anſwered; and although the Councel might at the finding of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion have taken it, yet it may be taken now; and it is not ſhewed how the old bank was inſufficient, nor what the charge would be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair it: Nor is it ſhewed how Tyd and Newton are in danger by the not repairing and making of the new bank. Alſo the Commiſsioners have exceeded their authority in exceeding the antient manner of taxing for the maintenance of this bank, and the tax ought to be laid according to the quality and quantity of the lands, which are to be taxed, and here doth not appear how many acres are in the ſeveral Vills, nor whether the tax doe extend to all, and the good land and bad lands are alſo equally taxed, neither ought there to be a new tax impoſed upon one Vill to eaſe another, which by the cuſtom ought to repair the bank: And they have alſo made a new Officer here, which by the Statute they have not authority, and have made an order to puniſh one for refuſing this Office, by diſtreſs of his goods, which ought not to be; and they ought not to refuſe a replevin of the diſtreſs taken, as they have here done, and the lands only that are lyable to the tax are to be diſtrained for it, and not the goods of another that is not within the extent of the Commiſsion, and upon theſe exceptions he prayed the preſentment might be quaſhed, <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, we will not make all the law void for ſome exceptions, therefore give notice upon what exceptions you will ſtand upon. <hi>Maynard</hi> anſwered, upon theſe. <hi>1.</hi> That there ought not to be ſuch a tax laid, becauſe the lands taxed are not within the extent of the Commiſsion; for it appears not that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Hundred of <hi>Wisbitch.</hi> 2ly. All the Inhabitants within all the Vills are not taxed, which ought to be, becauſe they have equal benefit, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the preſentment. <hi>The Court ordered it ſhould be moved again the next term.</hi> And <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> asked why the drainers ſhould not diſcharge this charge, who have been the cauſe of it, and they receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by their draining; and it is not fit they ſhould prejudice others by it. <hi>Poſtea.</hi>

The eſtate <hi>of Morgan</hi> was forfeited to the State, and they <hi>out of it</hi> doe make an eſtate for <hi>Pymm,</hi> with retroſpection to the year <hi>1641,</hi> and no further; and therefore the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49377:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſetled before that time is not taken away: And if a Statute have a double ſence, one againſt Common Iuſtice, and the other with Common Iuſtice, in equal ballance, it ſhall be interpreted in the better ſence; and that that hath been objected, that there is a power of revocation in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement is not material; for <hi>Morgan</hi> is now dead, and ſo this perſonal power is now gone, and ſhall not hurt the ſettlement. A ſecond reaſon is taken from the ſcope of the Ordinance, which conſiſts of three parts: <hi>1.</hi> The Parliament injured. 2ly. <hi>Morgan</hi> the Offender puniſhed, 3ly. <hi>Pymm</hi> rewarded, and the Ordinance ſhall not be ſtretched to puniſh <hi>Mary,</hi> who hath a particular intereſt, although there be not an expreſs ſaving for her in the Ordinance, <hi>21 H. 7.4.

It was anſwered, that there is the ſame reaſon to provide for <hi>Morgans</hi> ſtate that was rightly conveyed from him before the year <hi>1641.</hi> as of a ſtrangers ſo deriving from <hi>Morgan.</hi> It is alſo objected that the Truſtees for <hi>Pymm</hi> and the Common wealth ſhall have <hi>Morgans</hi> lands, and they ſhall not be ſaid to be forfeited. It was anſwered, that the Act diſtributes no more than is forfeited, which can be no more than <hi>Morgan</hi> had at that time. 2ly. The Parliament took no notice that <hi>Morgan</hi> was ſeized in fee ſimple, nor what eſtate he had. 3ly. After the eſtate of <hi>Mary Morgan</hi> ended, the reverſion in fee returns to <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> ſo that Mary hath but a particular eſtate, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may be ſatisfied though <hi>Mary Morgans</hi> eſtate be not forfeited; for the reverſion may be forfeited, and the particular eſtate preſerved, as <hi>Cleres</hi> Caſe is; and the ſaving is not here repugnant, as it is objected, nor deſtroyes the generality of the Ordinance, for it is here ſatisfyed. And the Parliament doth not take notice of the conveyance made by <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> nor of any other eſtate than that he had at the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Ordinance; otherwiſe there would be a great inconvenience; but it is objected, that the Sons claiming under <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the ſaving.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49377:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Dike-réeves, for mony expended in repairing a Sea wall, by laying a tax upon divers Vills, amongſt which <hi>Owtwell</hi> was one: divers exceptions had been formerly taken to the preſentment and order. At this time it was <hi>1.</hi> objected, that the Commiſsioners cannot alter the uſual cuſtom for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the tax, as they have here done: and therefore their Order is not good. It was anſwered, that there is no cuſtom here preſented; but if there be, yet the tax cannot be laid generally upon the Vill, but diſtributively; for every one of the inhabitants have not an equal ſhare of the land, nor are all the lands of equal goodneſs: And there is no cuſtom for the Vill of <hi>Owtwell</hi> to approtion the tax, ſo that they have no authority to doe it. <hi>Windham</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, that there is no preſcription or cuſtom here found, and ſo the tax ought to be ruled by the Common Law, and other Towns ought thereby to be Contributory, which receive benefit by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bank; and the Commiſsioners of Sewers have not here pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the direction of the Statute of Sewers as they ought to doe. And here the preſentments, upon which this order for the tax was grounded, were made by three Iuries of ſeveral Hundreds, and the breach to be repaired doth not appear to be within any of the Hundreds whence the Iuries come, as the Statute doth direct, neither is it ſhewed how the inhabitants are chargeable, whether by tenure, or cuſtom, or how elſe. <hi>Holhead</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, It is not ſaid how the lands are lyable to the tax. <hi>1.</hi> It is not ſhewed in what part of the Poe-Dike the breach hapned. <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide ſaid, that the Commiſsion of enquiry finds by what default the breach happens, but they cannot tell how many acres every one holds, to charge them ſeveral; and it may be intended that they hold joyntly, and it ſhall be intended that the lands are lyable to the tax by preſcription, and it is not neceſſary to ſhew in what place of the Poe-Dike the breach happened, <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, the preſcription here is waived; for you ſay that it was not an inevitable breach, and ſo you are at the Common law, and not upon a cuſtom, and then the tax ought to be equal, and according to the number of the Acres, and it is not ſo here. And it appears not that the breach is within the Hundreds whence the Iury came and ſo they have no authority to enquire. <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, that there is a clauſe to help this, for there is a power in the Commiſsioners to eaſe them that have wrong done to them. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> This will not help,<note place="margin">Tax.</note> for the tax ought to be well and equally laid, according to the Statute, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the number of the Acres, and here it is laid upon the perſons of the inhabitants. <hi>Therefore make a new tax.</hi>

                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:49377:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>who argued for the Plaintif; who ſaid, the Queſtion is, Whether the eſtate ſetled by Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> before the year <hi>1641.</hi> be forfeited by the Act of Parliament, and conſequently well given to Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> or no? And he ſaid, the intent of the Parliament in making this Act is firſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted: and he held, that according to the Act no eſtate paſſeth, but ſuch eſtate as <hi>Morgan</hi> had in the year <hi>1641.</hi> and no more; for no man can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a thing that he hath not, but only that which he hath; but <hi>Morgan</hi> then had not this eſtate: and therefore he could not forfeit it. 2ly, There is a priority of veſting the eſtate in the Parliament, and next from the Parliament to the Truſtees, and the Truſtees can have no more than is forfeited to the Parliament, and the eſtate ſetled before the year <hi>1641.</hi> is not forfeited to the Parliament. 3ly, The penning of the Act is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; The Act ſaith all the ſaid lands, that is all the ſaid lands that <hi>Morgan</hi> had in the yeart <hi>1641.</hi> and not all the lands that <hi>Morgan</hi> ever had before that time, and had ſetled; for the precedent words are reſtrained by the words ſubſequent, <hi>Althams caſe, 8 Rep. Dyer 369.</hi> and from the preamble of the Act to make a conſtruction to puniſh innocent perſons, is againſt the Law of God, Man, and Nature, <hi>Nichols caſe, f. 398.</hi> Of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments conſiſt the eſſence of Commonwealths, and it could not be the intent of the Parliament to puniſh innocent perſons, <hi>3 Ed. 4. 2.</hi> The Parliament did not intend to give more of <hi>Morgans</hi> eſtate, than what he had <hi>1641.</hi> for then they might give that which might be evicted, which they intended not. And whereas it is objected, that there is a clauſe of Revocation in <hi>Morgans ſettlement</hi> and ſo the eſtate was not abſolutely ſetled; It is anſwered, That notwithſtanding this power of Revocation, the eſtate is not given by this Act <hi>unto Pym;</hi> for it cannot give a power, <hi>7 Rep. 13.</hi> and a power can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forfeited, and <hi>Mary Morgan</hi> had an intereſt in the land, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the power of Revocation. And notwithſtanding there is no ſaving for <hi>Mary,</hi> yet the eſtate is not paſſed; for <hi>Mary Morgan</hi> is not intended to be puniſhed, <hi>Nichols caſe, Com. f. 483.</hi> and ſo there needs no ſaving for her, <hi>14 H. 8. f. 2.</hi> and it cannot be intended becauſe there is no ſaving for her, that therefore ſhe ſhall forfeit her eſtate, and the ſaving is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore idle; for it hath an operation another way. The ſaving is not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the eſtate of a Collateral Aunceſtor only, for this is the begging of the queſtion, for the ſaving ſaves not any thing, and the penning of the words are againſt this expoſition: and ſo he concluded, that nothing was given by the Statute to Mr. <hi>Pym,</hi> but the eſtate of <hi>Morgan</hi> which he had in the year <hi>1641,</hi> and prayed judgement for the Plaintif. <hi>Steel,</hi> the Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> for the Defendant, ſaid, he would only anſwer the argument of <hi>Twiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> becauſe he had heard no other arguments. And firſt he held, that the Ordinance reaches all the eſtates that <hi>Morgan</hi> had, as well before, as at the time <hi>1641.</hi> and the eſtate ſetled by <hi>Morgan</hi> before <hi>1641.</hi> was the eſtate of <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> in the year <hi>1641.</hi> 2ly The lands are expreſly named which are given by the Statute, &amp; it is not material who hath the eſtate in them for <hi>certitudo nominis tollit demonſtrationem, Dowbey</hi> and <hi>Dudingtons caſe,</hi> and <hi>Mildmayes caſe, 1 Rep.</hi> do interpret how the word <hi>others</hi> ſhall be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted. And here cannot be ſaid to be any injuſtice in the Parliament. The Queſtion here is, Whether the eſtate be ſetled by the Parliament? and if it be ſetled, it would be a ſuppoſition of injuſtice, to ſuppoſe it is not rightly done. The Law hath inveſted the Parliament with a power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all lands, and therefore it cannot be intended injuſtice; And the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate is not in <hi>Mary Morgan</hi> notwithſtanding the Conveyance, becauſe there is a clauſe of Revocation in it; for it is a void Conveyance as to her eſtate, by reaſon of the clauſe of Revocation, for that makes it fraudulent. And the eſtate of <hi>Mary Morgan</hi> is not paſſed by the Statute, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49377:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>the clauſe of eviction in the Ordinance, an if or an an are no ſaving of an eſtate, and here is no eviction in the caſe: and here is no ſaving, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their eſtate cannot be ſaved, for then the lands are all paſſed, And the ſaving extends to the lands deſcended to the Children of <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> from Collateral Anceſtors, and not from <hi>Tho. Morgan</hi> the Father; and as reaſonable a Conſtruction ought to be made of an Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as this is, as of an Act of Parliament, and ſo he praid Iudgement for the Defendant. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid He did not doubt of the power of the Parliament in this caſe, but of their meaning, whether they intended theſe lands ſhould be forfeited, or not: And the Ordinance was made by the Houſe of Commons without any proviſo in it, and the proviſo was put in by the Houſe of Lords, and he enclined that <hi>Mary Morgans</hi> eſtate was ſaved. But <hi>Jerman Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, he conteived that <hi>Maries</hi> eſtate was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but only the eſtate of ſtrangers. <hi>The Court was divided, and ſaid they would conſider till next Term, and then give Iudgement in this and the Caſe of</hi> Garret and Blizard.</p>

There are general words in the former Action, namely <hi>alia enormia,</hi> which words do comprehend the matter for which this Action is now brought, and he denyed the differences taken by the Councell on the other ſide. And it doth here appear to the Court, that the former Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe was brought for the ſame things, and damages were therein given for them, and it is unreaſonable to puniſh one twice for one and the ſame offence, and the averment is good, and doth ſhew that both Actions are for one and the ſame cauſe, and he hath recovered damages already for all the wrong he ſuſtained, and here is no converſion alleged in the Caſe, nor is it <hi>vi et armis,</hi> and the Law hates double vexation, <hi>2.

And <hi>Mr. Shafto</hi> hath taken a good ground, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Actions are for ſeverall things, and the Declaration is in part but an inducement to increaſe the ſcandall, and to prove it, and the words <hi>alia enormia</hi> ſhall not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of collateral matter, but of matter incident to the Act done; And one and the ſame thing may give ſeveral cauſes of Action, and one Action is not to be confounded with another Action. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, <hi>Laicons</hi> Caſe was not like this Caſe for the queſtion here is whether the Plaintiff can recover damages in this ſecond Action, which he hath by intendment recovered in the former Action, and he inclined that it may be ſo here, and that there is a recovering of the ſame damages in divers manners for the ſame thing. <hi>Nicholas Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, he may bring ſeverall Actions, although he might have joyned them both in one. <hi>Aſk Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, That one Act may be divided into divers Actions, and ſo it is here, and well enough. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, the Plaintiff in this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot recover damages for his Goods, ſo that this Action is brought for another matter. <hi>Therefore plead in chief if cauſe be not ſhewed to the contrary, for the Action doth well lye.</hi>

And if it do not remain in the Feoffees, yet it cannot revert to the Feoffor, for he hath conveyed from himſelf all the eſtate that he had, and if it return to the Feoffor, it is a diſſeiſin, <hi>2 Rep.

And ſo here the land paſſes one way or other; and if the uſe will riſe all the other points are out of dores. And there is here a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing conſideration to raiſe a uſe. But the main queſtion is whether the uſe riſeth to the Feoffor, if not, all the other points are gone. And he held

                  <hi>MOre</hi> Arreſted the <hi>Earl Rivers</hi> by a bill of <hi>Midleſex</hi> in a plea of Debt.

But the main que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion he inſiſted upon was, whether that by taking away the houſe of Lords in Parliament, whereby their voice and place in Parliament was gone, the Privilege of his peerage not to be arreſted for Debt, was alſo taken away, and he argued that it was not, for he ſaid, that at the Common Law, no <hi>capias</hi> did lye againſt a Peer,<note place="margin">Capias.</note> and the Statute of <hi>E. 3.</hi> which gave a <hi>capias</hi> for Debt againſt others, did not give it againſt a Peer, and it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear here that the Defendant is really an Earl, and not in nomination only, and he cited <hi>27 H. 8. f. 22. b</hi> The reaſons he ſaid why an Earl had the privilege not to be arreſted, are two. The firſt is in reſpect of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his perſon, being called <hi>comes a comitando rege</hi> (as ſome have thought,) and he is called by the King <hi>conſanguineus noſter.</hi> The ſecond is in reſpect of the preſumption of his ſufficiency of eſtate in lands to be ſummoned by, and not by reaſon of his place in Parliament, for they have the privilege not to be arreſted, as well in the vacancy of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as when the Parliament doth ſit, and the privilege of Parliament is that he ſhall not be ſued; but the privilege of peerage is, that he ſhall not be arreſted in his perſon, and ſo they are diſtinct privileges, and by taking away the Lords houſe, the former privilege is taken away, but not the latter, and this privilege (annexed to the perſon) not to be arreſted, may belong to a perſon that hath not the privilege of Parliament, as for example unto Widowes of Peers which could not be arreſted, and yet had no place in Parliament, ſo that the excluding them from the Parliament doth only take away their privilege of Parliament, and not their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of peerage, and <hi>Nevlils</hi> caſe is, that the privilege not to be arreſted belongs to them in reſpect of the dignity of their perſons, <hi>9 Rep. Salops</hi> caſe. And it hath been a queſtion whether <hi>comes</hi> be ſo called a <hi>comitando rege,</hi> or in reſpect of their Counties whereof they were Earls, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the latter derivation is the truer, and then the taking away the King takes not away their privilege, for the Counties remain. 2ly. Earls have by intendment ſufficient fréehold to enfcore them to come in, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at this day, and therefore are not to be arreſted, and impriſonment of a mans perſon for debt, was but a ſuppliment to make him anſwer where he had not ſufficient freehold, which we cannot intend here, <hi>Nat. brev. f. 93.</hi> And an Earl ſhall be amerced higher than another man, in regard of the preſumption of his freehold, and Earls are called <hi>majores Barones</hi> in this reſpect, <hi>7 E. 4 Nevils</hi> caſe, and the widow of an Earl had the privilege not to be arreſted, for the two very reaſons that her husband had it, ſo was it of a
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:49377:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>Biſhop, Abbot, and Prior of <hi>England;</hi> but otherwiſe it was of a Biſhop that had a Biſhoprick out of <hi>England.</hi> And the late Statute that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Kingly office, doth not take away their names, and dignities, nor the preſumption that they have fréeholds, and therefore they are not to be arreſted, and their will be ſince the Act, no more a failer of right than there was before, and ſo he prayed the Writ might be abated.<note place="margin">Abatement.</note> 
                  <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, your Clyent ought to have prayed the Writ might have abated, before he was turned over to the Marſhall of this Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer the queſtion was, whether a Copyhold were forfeited or not.</note> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded a ſpecial plea of juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Plaintif was a Copyholder to his Manor, and that for refuſing to appear and do his ſervice at his Court he had forfeited his Copyhold, and that therefore he did enter. The Caſe was this, The Defendant being Lord of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and holding of his Court, the Plaintif being Tenant, and being in the Court, and there being a queſtion whether the Court were legally then held or no, and being asked if he did appear or not, he anſwered, If it be a legal Court, I do appear, but if it be not a legal Court, I do not appear. The queſtion was, whether this be an appearance, or ſuch a refuſal to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear whereby the Copyholder ſhall forfeit his Copyhold, or not. <hi>Latch</hi> held it was no appearance, and that therefore the Copyhold was forfeited, and cited <hi>43 Ed. 3. f. 25.</hi> And he ſaid, though it be not expreſſed by the Defendant, that the Plaintif was legally ſummoned to appear in Court, it is not material, ſeeing he was preſent in Court, and did refuſe, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to appear. And that this was a ſufficient contempt to make a forfeiture. And he ſaid that the Rejoynder is ill; for it is <hi>dixit comparuit,</hi> and he doth not anſwer to the fact alleged, <hi>viz.</hi> That he denied to do his ſute and ſervice. <hi>Wild</hi> on the other ſide ſaid, that it is no forfeiture; for if the Court be well held, then he doth appear, as his words do plainly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and ſo there is no contempt; and if the Court were not well held, his not appearing ſhall not burt him, for he is not required to do it. <hi>37 Eliz. Eſt</hi> and <hi>Hardinges</hi> caſe, and <hi>4 rep. 27.

And the Replication hath not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled you to a forfeiture. Beſides it appears not here that the Court was legally ſummoned, as it ought to do, nor that there was any proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made for the holding of the Court, nor any notice given to the Tenants of the holding of the Court, <hi>38, 39 Eliz. Banc. Reg. Criſp</hi> and <hi>Dyer. Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> This caſe hath depended long.<note place="margin">Forfeiture.</note> It is a hard thing to make a forfeiture of the Copyhold, if there was a real controverſie whether the Court was well held or not; but if not, and that the words were uſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a ſhift to avoid the Plaintifs ſute and ſervice, it is a forfeiture; for the words are like Iack in a Box, and no body knows what to make of them. <hi>Ierman, Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>Ask</hi> enclined that it was no forfeiture. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed to the next term.</hi>

               <p>IN an Action upon the Caſe upon an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> made by the Defendant to pay the Plaintiff a certain ſum of money, at a certain day.<note place="margin">Special ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.

And whereas it hath been objected, that the debt upon the Accompt appears to be due by two, and that the Action therefore ought to have been brought againſt them both, and not againſt one of them as it is here, he anſwered, that the Action may be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both, or any one of them at the election of the party, and the cuſtom of Merchants makes no difference in the caſe, for the Law creates the debt and makes both lyable, though the cuſtom give election to ſue one or both of them, and ſo one may here be ſued, for the debt is by the cuſtom trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon one, although it be the debt of both.

                  <note place="margin">Fine. Error. Recovery.</note> and yet he ſaid that that binds an Infant until it be avoided by writ of Error.

Hales</hi> of Councel with the Plaintif made theſe queſtions, <hi>1.</hi> whether by the words of the Will a Fee-ſimple at the Common Law paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth becauſe there is an eſtate to <hi>Richard</hi> for life, and after to his heir in the ſingular number. And he argued that the word heir includes heirs, becauſe it is <hi>Nomen Collectivum:</hi> Next, Whether the deviſing the land to <hi>Richard</hi> for his natural life, and after to his heir for ever, makes any difference in the Caſe, and he held it did not, and ſaid, that <hi>Archers</hi> caſe that is objected by the other ſide differs much from this, for there the words are reſtrained; for it is <hi>Proximo Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redi,</hi> and not <hi>Haeredi</hi> generally, as it is in our Caſe; and there the words next heir are not words of limitation, but of purchaſe, and to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:49377:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>decipher the perſon, but not to limit the eſtate; and in our caſe if there ſhould not be a limitation, <hi>Richard</hi> ſhould only take for life, which is not the intent of the Will, as may appear by the paſſages, and clauſes of it. And <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Kemiſhes</hi> caſe, in <hi>5 Car.</hi> in this Court makes an end of our Caſe. Neither doth the adding of the word <hi>in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> make a difference in the Caſe, for if the words had béen omitted, the ſame eſtate had paſſed to the Tenant, <hi>Richard</hi> and his Eſtate is not enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by them. 2ly. The words <hi>in perpetuum</hi> relate to all the Eſtate, and not to any particular Eſtate, and ſo the ſurrender made by <hi>R. Hunt</hi> is good. Next of all, ſuppoſing that it be a limited Eſtate, and a contingent remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the queſtion will then be whether this contingent remainder be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or no, and I conceive it is, becauſe the particular Copyhold eſtate, which muſt ſupport this contingent remainder is deſtroyed, and the Law is the ſame in that point in Copyhold caſes, as it is in other caſes at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, for Copyholds are directed by the rules of the Common Law, <hi>13 Iac. Banc. Reg.</hi> It is alſo held, that there is the ſame rule to ſupport a contingent remainder of a Copyhold as there is of Land at the Common Law. Next it is to be conſidered whether the particular Copyhold eſtate, be extinguiſhed or not. And it is cléer that it is, for the cuſtomary Eſtate is in the Lord who hath the Fée ſimple, which cannot both ſtand together, and ſo there is no eſtate to ſupport the contingent remainder Copyhold, and conſequently all objections are by this anſwered. <hi>1.</hi> That the ſurrender ſhall not do wrong. 2ly. That the ſurrender deſtroys not the Cuſtom. <hi>Turner</hi> on the other ſide argued, that only an eſtate paſſeth to <hi>Richard</hi> for life, and that the word Heir is not a word of limitation, to make the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor take a Fée ſimple, neither ſhall the word Heir be taken <hi>Collective</hi> here but <hi>ſingulariter,</hi> and ſo according to the common ſence, number, and matter ought it to be conſtrued. And <hi>Nowns Collective</hi> in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber do not ſignifie the ſame thing, that they do in the plurall number, as may be proved by other examples, and there is no proper name to ſignifie one particular Heir in Law, if the word Heir in the ſingular number ſhall not do it, <hi>Shellyes caſe, 1.

               <p>THe Counteſſe <hi>Rivers</hi> was arreſten by a bill of <hi>Midleſex,</hi> and prayes in Court by her Councell that the Writ may abate,<note place="margin">Arguments touching pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage not to be arreſted.</note> and the Precept, and pleads her patent, whereby ſhe was created a Counteſſe, and ſo pleads that ſhe ought not to be arreſted. <hi>Latch</hi> of Councell againſt the Counteſſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that her patent was not good, becauſe it wants the words of inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are materiall words in the making of an Earl or Counteſſe, for although the Act of inveſtiture may be omitted, becauſe ſhe is a woman and ſhe cannot be girt with a ſword, yet ſhe may be cloathed with a mantle, as it is in the <hi>Inſtitutes, f. 16.</hi> and ſo was it in the caſe of <hi>Ann Bullein</hi> that was made Marchioneſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> and of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Finch,</hi> made Counteſſe of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> by King <hi>Iames, 6 Iac. Paſch. 1.</hi> but in this Caſe there was a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> to diſpence with the clauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, and in the viſcount <hi>Barkleys</hi> caſe, the patent whereby he was made Earl of <hi>Nottingham</hi> was adjudged naught, for want of this clauſe. 2ly. It doth not appear by the patent, that ſhe is made an Engliſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs, and then ſhe hath no privilege, <hi>8 Rich. 2. Banc. Reg. 204. 11 E. 3. Banc. re. 473.</hi> Neither is there any relation to the patent to any place, of which ſhe is made a Counteſs. For although the patent be ſealed with the Engliſh broad Seal, this is not materiall, for outlandiſh honours may be granted by the broad Seal of <hi>England.</hi> 3ly. The cauſe that ſhe ſhall have privilege of an Engliſh Counteſſe is not material, becauſe ſhe is not made an Engliſh Counteſs, and ſhe is no Counteſs to have privilege againſt the Common Law, although ſhe may (it may be) have her privilege in point of honour in the Marſhalls Court and Heralds office, becauſe there is no publique good and ſervice in making her a Counteſs, <hi>43 E 3.4.</hi> for being a woman ſhe cannot be imployed in Arms, or otherwiſe for the publique. And an Embaſſador cannot have privileges granted him, which do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern him as an Embaſſador, <hi>Dyer 60. and 1.1 H. 7. rot. 24 C. Banc.</hi> The King cannot grant one to be exempted from arreſting, as it is in <hi>Cooks Mag. Char. Paſc. 7 H. 8. rot. 66 C.

Keiw. 190.</hi> And there is no inſtance to be given of a woman made a Counteſs, that was ever frée and protected from arreſting. In the Statute of <hi>20 H. 6. C. 9.</hi> for Earls wives, and <hi>21 H. 8.</hi> to qualifie Chaplains, there is no notice taken of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſes by creation, but only of Counteſſes dowagers, or Counteſſes by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, <hi>6 rep. 9. C. de Rutlands</hi> caſe, and <hi>Ann Bullein</hi> was tryed <hi>per pares</hi> as ſhe was Queen, and not as ſhe was Marchioneſs of <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> And further the privileges of Earls and Counteſſes are now extinct, for the cauſe of thoſe privileges, <hi>viz.</hi> the King and houſe of Lords are extinct, and gone, and the privilege of being free from arreſts is a privilege executory, and not executed. Neither doth the ſufficiency of their poſſeſsions only give them the privilege not to be arreſted; but their publique ſcrvices to the State, which is the final cauſe of the privilege, and the other was but a partiall cauſe, and not the ſole cauſe. Reliefs were payed by Barons and Earls, when Earldoms and Baronies were created; but they are not now payed as they were then, but according to the value of the poſſeſsions now, and Amercements of Earls and Barons were equall. The privileges of Earls and Barons was derived originally from Soldiers, after it was derived to Biſhops, and great Counſellors, and ſo it appears that they
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49377:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>were privileged in reſpect of publique imployments, and not by reaſon of their revenues. All the Abbots and Priors had the privilege not to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, yet all were not Lords of the Parliament, <hi>21 E. 3. Mich. 59. Treſ.

The privileges have ſeverall expreſsions, and the reaſons for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the lay peerage is fully expreſſed in the Writs directed to them, <hi>Regiſt. 287.247. Raſt.

Inſt. 16 b. 6 rep. 63.</hi> And laſtly miſchief and miſery will enſue to many, if this privilege ſhould be allowed, and the very matter ſpeaks for it ſelf, and ſo he prayed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Plaintif. <hi>Hales</hi> of Councel on the other ſide prayed the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege might be allowed, and he followed <hi>Latch</hi> in the points of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And firſt he ſaid, that the thing grounded by the Patent is only in creation of the dignity, and there is no need here of inveſtiture, for if there were, then a recital of it ſhould be alſo neceſſary, but becauſe it needs not, therefore it needs no recital of it in the Patent. <hi>Seldens Tit. of honour, f. 876.21 R. 2.</hi> There is a recital of an Inveſtiture, but there was no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture, and ſo it was not material, and a <hi>non obſtante</hi> is to no purpoſe to diſpence with the want of Inveſtiture, if it were neceſſary, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the making the new Patent of the Lord <hi>Barkeley</hi> was not for the want of the Clauſe of Inveſtiture, for the Inveſtiture is a ceremony of the Heraulds, and not eſſential to the Honour. And although there be no certain place of denomination of the place of the Earldom, yet is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent good, for it may be out of <hi>England,</hi> and yet ſhe may be an Engliſh Counteſs notwithſtanding, Although I agree that forein honours may be granted by the Broad Seal of <hi>England;</hi> but here be ſufficient words to expreſs her to be an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Counteſs, &amp; the moſt proper that can be, <hi>viz.</hi> the Patent. Creations of ſuch honours have been frequent, &amp; ſhe hath alſo a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient eſtate to ſupport her dignity: I confeſs that it is true that no perſon can be privileged from Arreſt by grant; but here the privilege enſues the Patent of her Counteſhip by Cuſtom and Law, as incident to it. The King cannot grant a privilege to impriſon, but if he grant a Court, the power to impriſon follows neceſſarily upon it; And the privilege which the Law gives to the perſon of a Counteſs, is that which exempts her from Arreſt, as it appears in the Caſe of a Counteſs by Mariage, and a Counteſs by Creation is more honourable than a Counteſs by Mariage; and therefore ought to have as high privileges as the other; and the Statute made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Counteſſes, the wives of Earls and Barons do appertain to a Counteſs created; for thoſe Statutes were but an affirmance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and did introduce no new Law. This privilege is not taken away, for it aroſe by Cuſtom and by the Common Law, and not from Foreiners, as <hi>Latch</hi> conceives, and ſo the reaſon of that cannot be as he urgeth, but by the privilege of the perſon which indures as well when there is no Parliament, as when there is, and this privilege is during life, and not like to a privilege granted by reaſon of employment. For a Counteſs
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49377:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>Dowager hath no more reaſon to be privileged, in relation to military em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment than a Counteſs by Creation, and by the late Act no employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken away; And for the Clergy they were privileged from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, not becauſe of employment, but by reaſon of the eminency of their perſons. There may be an Earl or a Baron by writ or by preſcription, and there it ought to be certified by writ; but here the honour being by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Patent may be pleaded to certifie it, as well as if it were certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by writ, and to plead it thus is the more proper way. A Baron ought not to be ſtiled <hi>Dominus</hi> in a writ, but by his Chriſtian name, and addition of Knight, if he be one, if he have no ſpecial name of Barony in his Creation. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> demanded, if one be made a Baron, and be not called to the Parliament by writ, or comes thither by virtue of ſome clauſe in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſhall he be exempted from Arreſt? <hi>quaſi diceret non.</hi> And if one heretofore had had twenty Knights fees,<note place="margin">Privilege.</note> could he have come to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by reaſon of them? And held that the privilege is not allowable, for ſhe never had reference to the Parliament, or to do any other publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Ierman, Nicholas,</hi> and <hi>Ask Juſtices</hi> agreed with <hi>Roll</hi> in all. <hi>Roll</hi> ſaid, If the King grant a Town to be a Burrough, the grant gives it not privilege to ſend a Burgeſs to the Parliament, except there be ſpecial words in the Patent to warrant it; but if he make a County it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by Statute. <hi>Adjourned.</hi>

A man ſeiſed of a manor that had divers Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants that held for lives by old rents deviſeth it to his wife, during her life, with power to let and ſet, and make eſtates out of them, in as ample ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Teſtator might, if he were living. The queſtions were made by <hi>Latch. 1.</hi> Whether this power given her to ſet, and ſet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> doth not alter her Eſtate for life in the Lands deviſed to her. 2ly. Whether this power given her by the Will, adds any power to her eſtate for life, to make eſtates, and he held for the firſt, that the power given her did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her Eſtate. And 2ly. that it ads no power unto her Eſtate, becauſe the clauſe in the Will, is one entire clauſe, and not double and accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and ſo ſhe can make no greater Eſtates, than her eſtate for life will bear. And for the obiection that is made. That then the words that limit the power to her are void, and idle. He anſwered, that it is not neceſſary that all the words in a Will ſhould give ſomething; but ſome words may be explanatory of other words, and ſo are theſe words here, and yet the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49377:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>words here may add ſomething to her Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> to enable her to make Eſtates without impeachment of waſte. And the words ſhall not be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the time of Execution of the Eſtates made by the Feme, for then they are idle, <hi>Hill. 1 Car. Banc. Reg. Danyel and Vplins</hi> caſe. One may diſpoſe an eſtate by Will for life, with power to make Eſtates to continue after the death of the party that made them. But here the eſtate is made only out of the intereſt of the wife, which cannot endure after her life, <hi>Paſc. 44. Eliz. Bible and Dringhouſe,</hi> and ſo prayes Iudgement for the Plaintiff. <hi>Hales</hi> for the Defendant made theſe queſtions, <hi>1.</hi> What power was given by the Will; 2ly. Whether it were well executed; and he held the feme being executrix hath but an Eſtate for life; But ſhe hath a power to make eſtates, as ſhe hath done. There is no queſtion but ſuch a power may be added. The queſtion only is if this power be added here in our caſe, and he ſaid it was added by the expreſs words of the will, for elſe thoſe words are frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and operate nothing. In <hi>Danyel</hi> and <hi>Vplins</hi> caſe cited, which was entred, <hi>20 Iac. Hill. 720.</hi> there is no expreſs Eſtate given to the party, but a meer power only, and it was not by reaſon of the words added, for they are only conjunctive words. And <hi>Iuſtice Whitlock</hi> held there that the firſt words gave the power; Though <hi>Iuſtice Iones</hi> differed in opinion, and that caſe is the very ſame with ours; The reaſon in our caſe, That the words give power to the feme, may appear by the comparing this part of the Will with the other parts of it. In other parts of the Will where things are deviſed to his wife, theſe words here uſed are not added, and that argues that the Teſtator intended the Feme more power, than in other things deviſed to her, and the words themſelves being a deviſe of a manor, proves by the nature of the thing, that the Teſtator intended to give power to the Feme, to make Eſtates out of the manor. And it cannot be intended, that the words <hi>In as ample maner, &amp;c,</hi> do only give the feme power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign over her term, <hi>Vaughan</hi> and <hi>Longs</hi> caſe, <hi>24 C.</hi> the words were adjudged to be words to enlarge the power of the Legatée, and ſo are they here. And the ſubſequent clauſe during the term of her life, reſtrains not the power, for theſe words may be either referred to the Eſtates to be made, or to the time of making them, and here they are referred to the execution of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this is more ſuitable to the intention of the party in ordinary reaſon, and they are added to expound the intent, <hi>viz.</hi> that the remainder limited o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall not hinder the feme, for he hath not barred her out, and hath impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this truſt in her as Executrix, and as Legatee. And for the <hi>2d.</hi> point here is a good Execution of the power, for it ariſeth partly out of her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and partly out of her Authority, and both may well ſtand together, and the Eſtate made out of both is a good Eſtate, or if not, the Eſtate may be intended to ariſe out of the power given her to make ſuch an Eſtate, and not out of her intereſt, and the joyning of her daughter is not materiall, though no good eſtate be derived from her, and ſo he prayed Iudgement for the Defendant. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> It is uſual in the Weſt of <hi>England</hi> to make Eſtates for lives upon the old rent; but it is not here expreſſed of what nature this manor is, or whether it uſed to be let, and here is no limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to let for lives. But here either the laſter words are idle, or elſe the Feme hath ſuch a power, that ſhe may deſtroy the remainder. And itſh all not be intended that he truſted his Executrix, with more than he gave her, and the words of the Will do not expreſs that, and the queſtion is how it ſhall be interpreted. The words may be interpreted <hi>Cumulative.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the feme hath power to deſtroy the remainder, which would be a hard conſtruction.

And
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49377:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Verdict is not well drawn up, for the Caſe might have been made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for all the land may be in Demeſite for ought appears by the Verdict. <hi>Adjourned to be argued again, Poſtea.</hi>

               <p>For the <hi>1</hi> point I hold that here is a good grant of this new Office, and that the word <hi>Conſtituimus</hi> is not neceſſary, becauſe that there are ſpecial fées alſo newly granted. 2ly. This is not an Office in groſs, conſiſting and reſting upon it ſelf; but it is a relative Office or an imployment incident in the intereſt of the houſe granted, and therefore the word. <hi>Conſtituimus</hi> is not here neceſſary, <hi>Dyer 200.</hi> 3ly.

                  </hi> To the <hi>3</hi> point &amp; the chief queſtion, whether the Copyhold eſtate be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or extinguiſhed, he held it was extinguiſhed, and cited <hi>Knights</hi> caſe, &amp; <hi>Alton woods</hi> caſe, and ſaid, that the rules of the Civil Law ought not to be applyed to the Common Law, nor to be cited to perplex the proceedings thereof, and were this in the caſe of a Common perſon, without doubt the Copyhold eſtate would be deſtroyed, <hi>20 Eliz.</hi> by <hi>Popham</hi> and <hi>Fenn,</hi> and the King here hath the Fee ſimple, and there is no difference between the caſe of the King, and of a Common perſon in this regard; a thing which will not paſs by the King without notice; will not paſs with notice, and here is no prejudice to the King in not taking notice whether by the Patent the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to grant Copyhold eſtates be deſtroyed or not; and here is a neceſſary conſequence in Law, that the cuſtom is deſtroyed, becauſe the King that had the fee in the Manor hath ſuſpended the Copyhold by his grant. All the Arguments uſed on the other ſide are to deſtroy the Kings grant, and the caſes put do all differ from our caſe, and do ſtand upon their own bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms: Nor ſhall the King be intended to be miſ-conuſant of his particular grant, ſuch as this is, although he may be in a general grant. <hi>lib.

As to the laſt point, whether the Patentee ſhall be in the ſame condition as the King was, he ſaid that it is not material whether he be or no, as to the Caſe in queſtion, and reſted upon the <hi>3</hi> queſtion. If the King hath free, warren in land, and grants the land, and mentions not the warren, yet the warren paſſeth by the grant: And here out Avowry ſtands <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> becauſe the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif hath made no title. A grant of a Manor <hi>per nomen maneriorum</hi> is a good grant of the Manor, and here is a good grant, and if not, yet it is help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Statute of <hi>3 &amp; 4 Phil. &amp; Mar. C. 1. 1 H. 7. f. 28</hi> and the <hi>Poſtea</hi> here refers not to the grant of the Copy, and here is no ouſter alleged, and if there be, there is do diſſeiſin, but it paſſeth an eſtate for will between the parties. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> It would be dangerous to make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent void, becauſe the King took no notice of the Copyhold eſtate, and this point is not fit to be argued: A thing not materially alleged in pleading is not neceſſarily to be anſwered, and it is not neceſſary to create ſuch an Office as this is, for it is but an employment. The great queſtion is, whether after the death of Sr. <hi>Iohn Gate,</hi> the Copyhold eſtate can be revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or not in the caſe of the King. It may be dangerous whether it be one way, or the other. As to the pleading we will not make it ill, if it may be
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:49377:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>good. <hi>Argue the great point again, for it is a difficult point, and of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Ierman Iuſtice</hi> to the ſame effect, and enclined, that the King had no intent to deſtroy the Copyhold, and he held that the Office was well granted, becauſe it was but an imployment. <hi>Nicholas Iuſtice</hi> inclined, that the Copyhold was deſtroyed. At another day <hi>Wadham Windham</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for the Plaintif; and firſt he put the caſe at large, and then ſaid, that <hi>1.</hi> It appears by the replication that the Avowant hath no title. <hi>2.</hi> He confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that the Plaintif hath a Title.

As to the queſtion, whether when a Copyhold comes to the King, and he leaſeth it, this doth not ſo deſtroy the Copyhold, that when the leaſe is out it may not be Copyhold again. I hold, that if a Common perſon leaſe a Copyhold, the Copyhold is deſtroyed; but it is not ſo where the King lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, as it is in our caſe, which ought not to be meaſured by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of Law, for the Law of the Crown over-rules the Common Law, and the Law of Cuſtom, <hi>22 E. 3.</hi> The King is not bound by Cuſtom
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49377:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>as a common perſon is, <hi>35 H. 6.</hi> The King having Gavelkind lands may deſtroy the Cuſtom which runs with ſuch lands <hi>pro tempore</hi> only, and the Kings grant ſhall not enure to a ſecondary operation, as <hi>Knights</hi> caſe is; and here is no prejudice to any perſon that the Copyhold eſtate ſhould be revived, here the conſequence may be ſevered, and it is not neceſſary; and therefore the leaſe of the Copyhold, not naming it Copyhold, is good. As to the Objection made, that it is no benefit to the King to make it Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold again; the anſwer is, That it is a prejudice to take away a mans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege and liberty, if there were no other inconvenience; but here is more, for there may be prejudice by loſing the Common, &amp;c. And the rule, that a Cuſtom is an entire thing and cannot be apportioned, ſhall not bind the King, although it do bind common perſons, and the Statute makes not the grant good as to the reverſion. The Copyhold is demiſed, and yet ſhall be demiſable hereafter, and ſo it may be pleaded, for pleading follows the Law: A Cuſtom interrupted in the right is gone for ever; but if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted but in part, it is not ſo, as it is in the caſe cited, where the King hath Gavelkind lands, <hi>Com.

It is anſwered that the other ſide hath confeſſed, that <hi>Tong</hi> hath a title, for they derive from her alſo, and the contrary doth not appear to the Court, and it being agreed, the Court will not make a doubt of it. He made <hi>3</hi> Queſtions, <hi>1.</hi> Whether the Manor of <hi>Chingford Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> paſſeth <hi>per nomen duorum illorum maneriorum de, &amp;c.</hi> 2ly. Whether if the grant be ill it be aided by Statute. 3ly. Whether it be helped by the Averment. For the <hi>1.</hi> he held, that here is a good grant, without any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment or aid of the Statute; for if the King grants two Manors one ſhall paſs, and <hi>e converſo,</hi> it ſhall not be ſo in the Caſe of the King, but it is good in the caſe of a Common perſon with an Averment. The grant of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Saperton cum Rippen</hi> is an ill grant for the incertainty of it; but here is no ſuch incertainty, here is no <hi>non noſmer</hi> of the thing, for the word <hi>nomina</hi> requires not a proper name; but it is all one, as if it had been expreſſed by words comprehending it, and the word Manors doth comprehend it. If the King grant his two Acres of Land lying in a Common field, although but one Acre is to be found, yet the grant is good, and it is not like to the grant of a Manor with the Advowſon, where the King hath but a moyety of the Advowſon, or a moyety of the Manor, for the Moyety is not actual in the whole, but one is actually in two, and ſo it is well named here. 2ly.

The Kings Prerogative exalts him above a Common perſon, but this cuſtom makes him equal to a common perſon, 2ly. The Cuſtom here cannot be ſupported; but here is an abſolute extinguiſhment of the Copyhold, ſo that it cannot be regran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

The laſt point is conſiderable, but <hi>prima facie,</hi> here the cuſtom is not deſtroyed. <hi>Ask Iuſtice</hi> to the ſame effect, and that it appears that the King intended to grant but one Manor. <hi>Roll,</hi> We will take time till the next term to ſpeak to the laſt point, which is only doubtfull, and to deliver our opinions. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice,</hi> the pleading of the party <hi>per nomen</hi> helps not the Patent, if it be not good in it ſelf. The next Term <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> for himſelf and the reſt of the Iudges, who he ſaid concurr'd in opinion with him, delivered the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Court to this effect. <hi>1.</hi> That they were agreed that the grant of the Office of the Cuſtody of the houſe is a good leaſe for life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it was Copyhold, and it is not neceſſary to recite in the grant that it is Copyhold. <hi>2.</hi> That after the eſtate for life is determined, the King may grant the houſe and land again by Copy of Court Roll, becauſe the Kings grants ſhall be taken favourably, and not extended to two intents, where there is no neceſsity for it, as there is not here, and we are not here to intend a collateral intent, and ſo the Copyhold is not deſtroyed; for the Law takes care to preſerve the inheritance of the King for his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:49377:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>and though there be an implication and an intent in the Teſtator here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deviſe the tithes, yet that will not ſerve, becauſe there wants words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this intent, and though this be in a will, yet there muſt be words uſed to ſupport the intent of the Teſtator, for wills muſt be ruled by the rules of the Common Law. <hi>Aſhinghurſt</hi> and <hi>Curtice</hi> his caſe, <hi>Mich. 7 Iac.

Sherwood</hi> and <hi>Winſton</hi> held, that tithes cannot be appendant to a Manor, <hi>1 Rep. 111. Albanies</hi> caſe, and here are no words in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo to paſs the tithes. It is true that tithes may lie in tenure, and that an Action of debt lies for them, but that is by the Statute <hi>19 Eliz Dyer f. 354.</hi> The word land in a will doth not extend to tithes, and heirs ought not to be diſ-inherited by doubtfull and ambiguous words, as it muſt be here, if theſe tithes ſhould paſs. Next, as to the verdict, he ſaid, that it is not thereby found that the Teſtator died poſſeſſed of the tithes, as it ought to have been, as it hath been adjudged <hi>43 Eliz.</hi> and ſo he prayed judgement for the Plaintif. <hi>Maynard</hi> of Counſel with the Defendant argued, That the tithes did paſs by the Will, otherwiſe part of the Will muſt be void, which ought not to be, if all parts may be ſo conſtrued that they may ſtand together, and he agreed that lands and tithes are diſtinct things; but in Wills it is not to be ſo much conſidered whether the words of them be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but what was the intent of the Teſtator in them, and whether they do declare his meaning or not; and here by conſtruction of the words by freelands inheritance is meant in oppoſition to Copyhold lands, or terms for years. 2ly. Here is a poſitive aſſertion of the Teſtator himſelf, that in his underſtanding he had free lands in <hi>Holford,</hi> for he had no other lands there, <hi>35 Eliz. Robinſons</hi> caſe, <hi>rot. 504.

                  <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> asked what he ſaid to the exception, that it is not found that the Teſtator dyed ſeiſed of the tithes, without doubt it had been ill upon a Demurrer, therefore ſee if you cannot help it by the notes by which the Verdict was drawn up. But for the matter in Law, me thinks it is a ſtrong caſe that the tithes do paſs, for we are in the caſe of a Will, where the meaning of the party ſhall be obſerved, if it may be found out by any means, though it cannot be collected <hi>ex vi Terminis,</hi> and ſhould it not be ſo here, part of the Will would be void, which may not be, if we can make it otherwiſe by a reaſonable conſtruction. But I will conſider of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and do you conſult with your notes. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice,</hi> The Verdict ought to find the dying ſeiſed, and till I am ſatisfied from the Notes I will deliver no opinion. <hi>Nicholas Iuſtice</hi> held both the deviſe good, and the Verdict alſo, but ſaid it had been otherwiſe upon a Demurrer.<note place="margin">Demurrer.</note> 
                  <hi>Ask</hi> Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to the ſame intent. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice,</hi> It is clear that the Teſtator inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deviſe the lands in <hi>Holford,</hi> and it is a good deviſe, but if the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict be imperfect it is for the Plaintif, but if otherwiſe it is for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant. <hi>The Court would adviſe touching the Verdict.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Special verdict in Treſpaſs and Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and upon a ſpecial Verdict found the Caſe was this. A man deviſed to <hi>I. S.</hi> his whole eſtate, paying his debts and Legacies, and dies poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Goods and Chattels, to the value of five pounds only, and dyed alſo ſeiſed in fee of divers lands, and was indebted forty pounds at the time of his death. The queſtion was, whether the lands paſſed by the Deviſe? <hi>Barry</hi> of Councel with the Plaintif argued, that the lands did paſs, becauſe that wills ought to receive a favourable conſtruction; And 2ly. The intent of the Teſtator is to be conſidered, who by the words <hi>all his eſtate,</hi> did mean to comprehend as well his land as his goods and chattels, for there is no reſtraint of the words here, <hi>7 Ed. 3.10.</hi> The word eſtate is a word of large extent, and extends as well to the real as perſonal eſtate, if it were in Caſe of grant. much more in the caſe of a Will. And there is another word uſed here to explain the Teſtators meaning to be to deviſe his lands as well as his goods, and that is the word <hi>All,</hi> which comprehends all manner of eſtates, without exception. Next if the land ſhould not paſs, his debts and Legacies cannot be paid, according to the expreſs intent of the Teſtator, and the intent of the party ought to be ſatisfied, although the words be not proper, becauſe it is in a will, though it might be other wiſe in a grant. And whereas it is objected that the Iuries finding of the value of the debts and Legacies, is to no purpoſe, becauſe the will cannot be helped by the averment of the Iury. I anſwer that averments if they ſtand with the will, may be received to make the Teſtators intent to appear. But beſides this is not an averment only, but a true ſtating of the Caſe, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to find out the Teſtators meaning. 3ly. The deviſee of the land is not made Executor, but Truſtee, or Deviſee, &amp; this is ſince the Statute of Deviſes <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> The <hi>2.</hi> queſtion is, what eſtate the Deviſee hath in the lands? &amp; I conceive he hath Fee. ſimple, becauſe he hath all the Eſtate, which muſt be the largeſt, and that is Fee-ſimple. <hi>Hob. rep. pl. 280.</hi> The word whole goes both to the quantity and quality of an eſtate alſo. And here the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49377:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>that he is to pay all his Debts and Legacies, is a good conſideration to paſs the fee-ſimple of his lands, and though there may be a ſurpluſage after the Debts and Legacies paid, this hinders nothing; for it is his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that the Deviſee ſhall have that ſurpluſage, and ſo he prayed Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Plaintif. <hi>Twiſden</hi> for the Defendant argued, that either nothing paſſeth by the Will, or if any thing, then only an eſtate for life paſſeth. He agreed that improper words may ſometimes pais things, yet ſometimes proper words will not paſſe things; <hi>viz.</hi> if the intent of the party appear to be contrary, <hi>24 Eliz,</hi> in the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberlands</hi> caſe. A Deviſe of all his Iewels, did not paſs his Collar of Eſſes, and his Iewels annexed to his Parliament Robes, and the words here are not that he deviſeth all his eſtate in his lands, but his whole eſtate generally, and if the words here ſhould paſs the lands, yet the fee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple paſſeth not, but only an eſtate for life in the lands, which do paſs; nor do the words paying his Debts and Legacies cauſe the Fee-ſimple to paſs, for here is no likelyhood of any loſs to the Executor; for the words are not, that he ſhall pay all his Debts and Legacies; and if he be an Executor, as the contrary appears not, he ſhall not be charged with more than the perſonal eſtate will diſcharge. The words do amount to a Condition, and it is not found that there are any Debts or Legacies paid, and ſo it is not performed, and the heir may well enter into the lands in queſtion, for the Condition broken. 2ly. The Verdict doth not find how the lands are held, whether in Socage, or by Knights ſervice; and ſo it appears not whether they can be deviſed or no, and they ſhall not be intended to be Socage lands, <hi>Dyer, f. 207. Hill. 32 El. rot. 2.</hi> and <hi>Pell</hi> and <hi>Browns</hi> caſe. 3ly. It is not found that the Teſtator dyed ſeiſed of the lands, as it ought to have been, and he prayed Iudgement for the Defendant.<note place="margin">Special Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict.</note> 
                  <hi>Roll. chief Iuſtice</hi> to the ſecond Exception to the Verdict anſwered, that in a Special verdict it is not neceſſary to find whether lands be held in Sorage, or by Knights Service, and he ſaid that the words in the Will do goe to the nature and extent of the eſtate, as <hi>Barry</hi> urged, and he doubted how the verdict ſhall ſupply the Will if it be defective, for that is only to make the intent of the Will certain. <hi>Adjourned to be argued again.

               <p>IN an Action upon the caſe a ſpecial verdict was found,<note place="margin">Special ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the caſe.</note> upon which the caſe fell out to be this. Two being ſeiſed of lands in Fée, did make a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of feoffment unto two others, and to their heirs, and in the deed was a letter of Attorney to enter into the lands in the name of the ſeoffors, and make livery and ſeiſin according to the effect of the deed, and livery of ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin was made to one of the Feoffees by the Attorney in the abſence of the other Feoffee. The queſtion was, whether here were a good livery and ſeiſin, or not? 2ly. Whether the letter of Attorney was good or no, in regard it had falſe latin in it, for the letter of Attorney was made by two, and the words of it are <hi>pro me, &amp; in nomine meo</hi> to make livery which are words of the ſingular number, whereas they ought to be of the plurall? <hi>Hales</hi> as to the <hi>2d.</hi> queſtion held the letter of Attorney good enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the authority given to the Attorney proceeds from both the Feoffors, and therefore the words ſhall be intended to be the words of both of them, as ſpoken by them ſeverally. And he alſo argued that the letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was well executed to both the Feoffees, becauſe it was by deed, and he cited <hi>15 E. 4 f. 18.</hi> and he ſaid, if the livery had been made by the Feoffor himſelf it had been good without queſtion, and there is no difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and our caſe, becauſe it is made according to the effect of the deed, and the Feoffee who is preſent is Attorney for the Feoffee that is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to receive livery for him, and the effect of the letter of Attorney is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, although the words are not, <hi>Cooks Lit. f. 5.</hi> and <hi>Hoxon</hi> and <hi>Polts</hi> caſe, <hi>in the Exchequer, 34 Eliz. Boltons</hi> caſe, Livery made to the husband, was held a good Livery to the wife alſo. <hi>Latch</hi> of Councel on the other ſide made two queſtions. <hi>1.</hi> Whether here was a good authority? 2ly. Whether it was well executed? For the firſt he argued, that here was no authority given to the Attorney to enter into the lands in the name of both the Feoffors, for the words are that he ſhould enter <hi>in nomine meo,</hi> which cannot comprehend both of them, the words being in the ſingular number, and he agreed that Livery made by the Feoffor himſelf to one, in the name of both had been good; but here the livery is by Attorney, and an Attorney hath nothing but a bare authority given him, which ought to be ſtrictly purſued, eſpecially it being to paſſe away an Eſtate. He alſo took exceptions to the ſpecial verdict, and ſaid that the tryal upon which the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict was found, was directed out of the Chancery to diſcover a fraud, and the verdict finds nothing according to the direction, and ſo it ought to be ſet a ſide, beſides the verdict in it ſelf is incertain, for it is of <hi>300</hi> Acres of land generally, which is incertain, and ſo the Plaintiff can have no Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Declaration warrants not the verdict, for the Declaration mentions Houſes, and Cottages, beſides the <hi>300</hi> Acres of land. 2ly. The verdict doth not find the date of the Indenture, and the Title to the land is to commence <hi>a die datus. Hales</hi> anſwered <hi>1.</hi> It ſhall be intended the day of the date. 2ly. It ſhall take effect after the delivery, if there be no day of the date expreſſed. And to that exception to the verdict, that there are not ſo many Acres conteined in it, as are expreſſed in the Declaration; he anſwered that the Iudgement ſhall go to all which is land in kind only, and ſhall not extend to Houſes, and Cottages, and there appears to be a
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49377:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>reſiduum,</hi> or ſurpluſage.<note place="margin">Verdict.</note> 
                  <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, that it is incertain by the verdict what lands are meant, for there are <hi>400</hi> Acres of land, and four meſſuages, and four Cottages, and <hi>40</hi> Acres of medow in the Declaration, and ſo there appears to be a <hi>reſiduum,</hi> beſides the land found in the verdict, which makes it to be incertain what is found. And though it ſhould be a verdict for part, and be uncertain for the reſt, although the Plaintiff will relinquiſh his damages for the reſt, this will not help it, for there muſt be two Iudgements, and the verdict is ill as to that which is found, yet he held that it might be good without relinquiſhing the damages at all, becauſe the verdict is good for ſo many Acres as are in the Declaration, and it ſhall be intended that the Iury miſtook the number of the Acres, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the verdict no more than the arrable land. <hi>Ierman</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Iuſtices</hi> doubted whether there be a verdict at all, becauſe the Iury have not found the things conteyned in the Declaration. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas, mutate opinione,</hi> held the verdict good; but ſaid it would have béen otherwiſe upon a demurrer, and it was ſaid that if one declare for <hi>40 l.</hi> and the verdict finds <hi>100 l.</hi> the Plaintiff may relinquiſh <hi>60 l.</hi> and have Iudgement for the reſt. <hi>Ask Iuſtice</hi> ſaid that his opinion was, that the verdict is incertain, and conceiveth that the Iury intended all in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. <hi>The Court took time to adviſe.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:49377:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>this conveyance made by the Bankrupt of his lands was within the Statute of fraudulent conveyances or not, and the ſale made by the Commiſsioners of this land were good. <hi>Maynard</hi> for the Plaintif ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that it is not within any of the Statutes of Bankrupts. The Déed here is without fraud; and ſo it is not within the Statute; for a valuable conſideration is only expreſſed in the Statute, and not a conveyance upon conſideration of mariage, as it was in our caſe. 2ly. The Feme is but one perſon with her Husband. 3ly. By comparing the Statutes together it appears that the wife is not compriſed within the Statute of <hi>1 Iacobi,</hi> which looks back to other Statutes touching Bankrupts, for the wife is not named in the Statute of <hi>1 Iacobi,</hi> but only children and other perſons, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the words of the Act which do enumerate children, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, would be frivolous and idle, <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, the Caſe is of great conſequence, and <hi>Criſp</hi> and <hi>Prats</hi> caſe doth ſomewhat reſemble this.<note place="margin">Bankrupt.</note> The Law intends a Bankrupt which is ſo by fraud, as well as a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt who becomes ſo by accident, and for this cauſe is he called an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Statute, and here the year of our Lord <hi>1637,</hi> is the <hi>13</hi> year of the late King; &amp; the recovery ſuffered by the Bankrupt was then, and within half a year after the recovery, he became a Bankrupt, ſo that me thinks there plainly appears to be fraud in the Conveyance,<note place="margin">Fraud.</note> but the fraud is not expreſſed in the pleading, as it might have been. The Statute of <hi>1 Iac.</hi> is ſomewhat doubtfull as I conceive, and I do not ſée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proviſion made in it againſt the wife, if fraud do not appear, for here is no valuable conſideration mentioned. <hi>Nicholas juſtice</hi> ſaid, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, yet he conceived it within the Statute of <hi>1 Iac.</hi> which ought to receive a large conſtruction, becauſe it was made for the good of the Commonwealth. <hi>Ierman</hi> and <hi>Ask</hi> agreed with <hi>Roll in omnibus.

                     </gap>o publico,</hi> yet this is nothing to our caſe, for this is not for the publique good, and therefore it is not good. 2ly. An autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ought to be countermandable, and to determine by the death of the party that gives the authority; but here it is not ſo, but it is to continue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death. Next, no man can give authority to another to do a thing which he himſelf could not do, but here it is otherwiſe, and therefore it is not good. Alſo by the death of the Copyholder the Law ſettles the lands in the heir, and an authority cannot diveſt them out of him; this is not like to the ſurrendring of Copyhold lands into the hands of the Lord, for ſuch a ſurrender cannot be revoked, but this authority may be revoked: But which is more, the Verdict here doth not find that the two Attorneys are cuſtomary Tenants of the Manor, but only by way of recital, which is not good, for they ought to have been found to directly; nor doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they were cuſtomary Tenants at the time of the admittance of the party, neither is there any poſſeſsion or title found in the Defendant, and ſo the Plaintif having primer poſſeſsion, the Defendant is culpable; neither is it found that the Cuſtomary Tenant, who gave this authority, had an eſtate in fee-ſimple in the lands, and if he had but an eſtate for life, he could not make ſuch a Letter of Attorney; neither is the authority gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven warranted by the Cuſtom, and ſo he prayed judgement for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif. <hi>Wilmot</hi> for the Defendant, As to the authority, he ſaid that it was good, and did well enough ſurvive the party that gave it, becauſe it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a ſpecial direction from the party that gave it. <hi>1 H. 7.8.</hi> and this is the reaſon that an Executor may ſell lands of the Teſtator after his death, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe his authority is ſo ſupported, <hi>21 E. 4. f. 8. 31 E. 1. Fitz. Grants 45.</hi> And here in our caſe the heir hath neglected his advantage, and therefore ſhall not now be admitted to take it. But beſides the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here given is more than a bare authority, for it is backed, with the circumſtances of time, perſons, and of a Cuſtom, which is not of a ſlight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in Law, and by ſuch a Cuſtom which is very reaſonable; for it is but to enable the party to diſpoſe of his own lands; and far more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Cuſtoms than this are allowed in our Law, as that in <hi>Kent</hi> for an Infant of <hi>15</hi> years of age to have power to ſell his lands; neither is this Cuſtom contrary to any poſitive rule of Law; for it is here to create the authority to begin after the parties death that created it, and ſo it is not to determine with his death, for till then it begins not, and the Cuſtom here is but to alien lands, which is no ſtrange thing, and this Cuſtom extends but within the Manor, which is but to a ſmall compaſs of ground; and ſo
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:49377:157" rendition="simple:additions"/>the publique is not much concerned in it, and the caſe of <hi>17 Car.</hi> in this Court, <hi>Bambridge</hi> and <hi>Whaddons</hi> caſe differs from our Caſe; for that was not ſupported with a cuſtome as this is. And it doth appear by the Record, that <hi>Dalby</hi> the Attorney is a cuſtomary Tenant, and the admiſsion is alſo found by the Verdict to be <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem Manerii,</hi> and ſo that is well enough, and then one cannot gain a Copyhold eſtate by diſſeiſin, and ſo no primer ſeiſin ſhall be intended, as was urged on the other ſide, and it is alſo found that the Copyholder was ſeiſed. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> It will be a hard matter to maintain the Cuſtom,<note place="margin">Cuſtom.</note> if it be not found that the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder was ſeiſed in fee of the Copyhold lands. 2ly. It is not here found that the land is demiſable, according to the will of the Lord, and ſo it may be free land, and then the cuſtom doth not extend unto it, nor is it found that the parties to whom the Letters of Attorney were made were Copyhold Tenants.<note place="margin">Diſſeiſin.</note> And the primer poſſeſsion will make a diſſeiſin here by the Defendant, if the cuſtom be not-well found, and ſo judgement muſt be for the Plaintif.<note place="margin">Deviſe.</note> And I cannot ſee how the Cuſtom can be good, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the rules of Law.<note place="margin">Surrender.</note> A man cannot deviſe Copyhold lands, and this caſe is worſe, but he may ſurrender to the uſe of his laſt Will.

Alſo the ſubject matter in fact doth prove this to be his intent, and although here is not a collateral averment to prove the intention, but a collateral proof to declare the Teſtators intent, this may be admitted to aſcertain the Court of his meaning, as it is in the caſe of proving an Act of Parliament.

It appears not that the diſcharge was in convenient time, for it was <hi>2</hi> years after; but admitting that to be ſo, yet here is no notice of the diſcharge, and that is neceſſary to be given, and it ſhall not be intended to be given without ſhewing it, for the Declaration ought to be certain, and here is no inducement in it that there was any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given in his preſence, and if it were given in his abſence, he ought to have notice given him of his diſcharge, elſe how ſhould he know it: and it were unreaſonable to charge him if he had no notice, and by a third perſon he cannot receive notice, as it is in the Caſes put by Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide.

<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49377:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>that if he would ſtay for the money till <hi>Mich.</hi> next, that then ſhe would pay it. Vpon <hi>non Aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, and a verdict found for the Plaintif, the Defendant moved in Arreſt of Iudgement, that here was no conſideration to ground the <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> upon, becauſe it was not the debt of the party that aſſumed to pay it, neither was ſhe Executor or adminiſtrator nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently lyable any way by law to pay it, and therefore an <hi>Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit</hi> to pay a remedileſs debt, if the Plaintif would ſtay for it, is no good <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſit,</hi> as in <hi>6 Car.</hi> in this Court, in <hi>Morgans</hi> Caſe. An <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> to pay the rent of the land behind, if the party would forbear to diſtrain Corn in the ſhocks, was adjudged no good <hi>Aſſumpſit,</hi> becauſe ſuch Corn is not diſtreinable, and it appears not here what perſon the Son was, or where he lived, or that he either had or leſt any goods, and the meer ground of the Action is the piety of the Mother, and no other matter, And here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears no perſon liable to pay this debt, neither plainly, nor by intendment, and the Ordinary is not chargeable if no goods come to his hands. And 2ly. There is now no Ordinary, for it is taken away by the Parliament, and <hi>9 rep.

The word heir is to be conſidered either in relation to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, and ſo one cannot make one his heir, or it may be conſidered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a thing to be inherited, to wit lands or tenements, and ſo one may make another his heir, and thus a Cuſtom may make one a mans heir, as it is in Borough Engliſh; and an accident may thus alſo make one a mans heir, as it is in the Caſe of poſſeſſio fratris, <hi>Coundens</hi> caſe, <hi>Hob. Rep. Caſe 947.</hi> And here it is all one to make one his heir, and to make hint heir of hislands; and the reaſons are, Firſt, the word heir here cannot have any other relation than to the Teſtators lands, for he cannot make him his heir otherwiſe, and the words may be more reaſonably intended ſo. 2ly. The words carry in them the plain intention of the Deviſor, that the party ſhould have his lands, although the words are not very proper

In ordinary ſpeech, if one make ſuch an one his Heir, it is intended that he gives him his lands, <hi>8 Car.</hi> in the <hi>C. B.</hi> in <hi>Spurt</hi> and <hi>Bents</hi> caſe. A deviſe of his inheritance, was held a deviſe of his lands, and <hi>Trin. 3. Iac. in Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi> caſe, A deviſe of all his rents in tayl paſſed his lands, becauſe in vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar acceptance it is the rents of lands, and in <hi>Pits</hi> and <hi>Sands</hi> caſe in this Court. A deviſe of all his free lands in <hi>Holford</hi> did paſſe a portion of Tithes, and in the caſe of one <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> a deviſe of all his eſtate paſſed all his lands. And the words cannot bear the fence to make him Executor, according to the Civill Law, as hath been objected, for the Will ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as it is, to be an Engliſh mans Will, and ſo the word Heir in it ſhall he interpreted according to out Law, and not the Civill Law, and even in the Civill law to make one his Heir doth convey unto him all his lands, for he is <hi>haeres teſtamentarius,</hi> although not <hi>haeres legitimus.</hi> And in this Will here are two expreſsions, for the party is made Heir and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, which two words cannot ſignifie one thing, for that would be an idle expreſsion. 4ly. There are ſome clauſes in the Will, which ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Teſtator was to convey his lands, if it were needful to make uſe of them. <hi>1.</hi> There are ſeveral annuities for the Deviſee to pay. 2ly. He directs him where the conveyances and aſſurances of his lands were laid up, which plainly ſhew he meant he ſhould have his land. 3ly. The words Heir and Executor are joyned together, to ſhew that he gives him all his lands and goods, elſe one of the words muſt be imperfect, and ineffectual, which ſhall not be intended. For Authority <hi>7 E. 6. Br. deviſe 38.</hi> by deviſing that one Son ſhall be Heir to the other, it ſhall be intended of lands, ſo in conſtruction of law it ſhall be here intended that the Deviſor made him Heir of his lands, <hi>Hob. Reports.</hi> in <hi>Sparkes</hi> and <hi>Burnells</hi> caſe, <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> ſhall be each others Heir, and it is not ſaid of land, yet adjudged that it ſhall be ſo meant, and ſo is it in our caſe, and if I have lands in ſee ſimple, and make one my heir, it ſhall be intended that he ſhall have my lands in ſee ſimple, although I ſay not that I make him Heir of my lands. For the ſecond queſtion, the reaſons before expreſſed do alſo ſhew that the lands are paſſed in Fee, as it is in <hi>Purnells</hi> and <hi>Hamble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> caſe, for the word Heir ſhall relate to the ſame Eſtate, that the party had in the land, who makes the other his Heir, <hi>8 Iac. Inkerſals</hi> caſe. For the <hi>3d</hi> point, whether here ſhall be any good deviſe at all, by reaſon of the falſe Engliſh, he ſaid it was all one, and to as good effect as if the words were all true Engliſh, and neither the incongruity, nor the inſufficiency of the words ſhall hurt the Will, as it is pretended. For <hi>1.</hi> This is not in caſe of pleading or of writs; but in conveyance of lands. It is true that in the former it doth hurt, becauſe writs and pleadings may be amended, if they be naught; but it is fatal in conveyances, for they cannot be amended, as in <hi>Trotman</hi> and <hi>Standards</hi> caſe, <hi>Trin. 1651.</hi> in this Court it was held that impropriety of words ſhall not hurt, it they can admit of a good conſtruction. <hi>Deſinet in piſcem mulier formoſa ſuperne.</hi> 2ly. This is in a Will, which is ſuch an inſtrument, that is much favoured in Law and therefore to be favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſtrued. 3ly, This is an Engliſh Will, and admits of much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of dialects, and therefore is not to be critically interpreted. Neither are there here any inſignificant, or miſsignificant words, as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, but ſignificant, for the ſound of the word as it is written is the ſame as if it had been rightly ſpelled, for Ayer and Heir ſound both alike. As in <hi>3 H. 4. f. 4 Baxter</hi> and <hi>Baxſter</hi> ſounded alike. 2ly. If the word Heir

For anſwer to the main objection, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>6 Car.</hi> there was a decree made in the Court of wards, by adviſe of the Iudges, that this was a void and ſenceleſſe Will, I ſay that that decree is not of ſo great waight, as is a Iudgement given in a Court of judicature at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and this was but an opinion delivered in Court, where the Iudges were not Iudges, and the decree was made as I am enformed. becauſe they believed the Will to be nonſence,<note place="margin">Heir.</note> the contrary whereof doth appear by my argument. The Court enclyned ſtrongly that the Teſtator intended to make the Deviſee Heir of his lands, and that the words can receive no other conſtruction, for other conſtructions would be very ſtrange,<note place="margin">Will.</note> and forced, and the party that made the Will, is to be conſidered as one that was <hi>inops conſilii,</hi> and alſo that wanted a ſcribe, and his intent ſeems plain, and ſhall not be taken according to the Civill law, and if it ſhould, the word Heir will as well extend to the lands as goods. <hi>Adjourned to be argued again.</hi>

               <p>VPon a ſpecial verdict found in an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> the caſe ſell out to be this:<note place="margin">Special Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſe.</note> A Copyholder of inheritance made a Letter of Attorney to two joyntly and ſeverally to ſurrender his Copyhold lands in Fee to certain u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, after his death, according to the Cuſtom of the Manor. The queſtion made by <hi>Ellis</hi> of Councel with the Plaintif was, whether the Cuſtom was good or not? &amp; he argued, that it was not a good Cuſtom. In Sir <hi>Iohn Davis</hi> Reports it is ſaid, a Cuſtom muſt be reaſonable, and a Cuſtom may be reaſonable, when it is but againſt a particular Law, and not a general Law; but the Cuſtom here thus to convey land, is againſt a general Law. Particular Cuſtoms may be againſt publique intereſt, <hi>pro bono public</hi> but if they be not, as in our caſe they are not, they are not good.<note place="margin">Pro bono publico.</note> Next an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given ought to be Countermandable, and to determine at the death of the party; but this is not ſo, and therefore it is no good authority, <hi>19 E. 3. f. 5.</hi> 2ly. None can give an authority to another to do a thing which he could not do himſelf; but here it is otherwiſe, and therefore it is not a good autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 3ly. By the death of the Copyholder the lands are ſetled in the heir, and this authority given ſhall not deveſt them, and this is not like the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring of lands into the hands of the Lord; for a ſurrender cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, but this authority is revokable. Next, the Verdict doth not find that the <hi>2</hi> Attorneys are Cuſtomary tenants, but only by way of recital, which is not good; nor doth it appear they were cuſtomary tenants, at the time of the admittance; and here is not found any poſſeſsion or title in the Defendant, and ſo the Plaintif having primer poſſeſsion, the Defendant is guilty; neither is it found that the cuſtomary Tenant had ſee-ſimple in the land; And if he had but an eſtate for life he could not make ſuch a letter of Attorney. Alſo the authority given is not warranted by the Cuſtom ſet forth. <hi>Wilmot</hi> of Councel with the Defendant, ſaid, That this authority here is ſupported with a ſpecial direction, which may ſurvive the party that gives it, <hi>1 H. 7.8.</hi> And an authority may ſurvive the party that gives it; elſe how can an Executor ſell lands by the authority given unto him, <hi>21 E. 4. f. 8. 31. E. 1. Fitzherb. 45.</hi> and as for the heir he hath neglected his advantage, it he had any, and cannot now take it: But beſides, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity here given is more than a bare authority, for it is backed with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and perſon; and here is alſo a Cuſtom to ſupport it, and this Cuſtom is a reaſonable Cuſtom, for it is but to enable a man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his own lands: and there are far more unreaſonable Cuſtoms than this allowed in our law, as the Cuſtom of <hi>Kent,</hi> for one of the age of <hi>15</hi> years to be enabled to ſell his lands, and this Cuſtom is not againſt any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive rule of Law, for the cuſtom is, to create the authority to begin after his death, and ſo it is not to determine by his death; for till then it begins not; and the Cuſtom here is but to alien lands, which is no ſtrange thing,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:49377:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>and it is extended but within a ſmall compaſs of land, and ſo cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prejudicial to the publique.

But 2ly, it is not here found that the land is demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, according to the will of the Lord, and ſo it may be free land, &amp; then the cuſtom doth not reach it. Neither is it found that the <hi>2</hi> Attorneys were Copyhold Tenants, and the primer poſſeſsion here will make a diſſeiſin by the Defendant, if the Cuſtom be not well found, and then it is for the Plaintif, and I cannot ſee how the Cuſtom can be good, it being againſt the rules of Law; for a man cannot deviſe a Copyhold, and here the caſe is worſe,<note place="margin">Deviſe.</note> but he may ſurrender to the uſe of his laſt Will and Teſtament. At another day <hi>Wilmot</hi> to the Exception taken, That it is not found that the two Attorneys were Tenants of the Manor, ſaid, there is ſo much found as ſhall make them be preſumed to be Tenants of the Manor, for it is found that the party is admitted <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem Manerii,</hi> which cannot be a good admittance if they were not Tenants. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> anſwered, to be admitted <hi>ſecundum conſuetudinem,</hi> goes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IN an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> a ſpecial Verdict was found, upon which the Caſe fell out to be this, A man being Leſſee of a Manor for <hi>199</hi> years,<note place="margin">Special Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectione fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae.</note> devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Term to his wife for life, with power to make ſuch eſtates in as ample manner as he himſelf might have done, during her life, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in Tall to his Daughter, and dies, the Feme proves the Will and accepts of the Legacy, and after makes a Leaſe for <hi>99</hi> years, and dies, and the daughter brings an <hi>Ejectione firmae</hi> againſt the Leſſee of the Feme. The queſtion was, whether this Leaſe made by the Feme were a good Leaſe or not. <hi>Merifield</hi> argued, that the Leaſe was not good after the death of the Feme, becauſe ſhe having but an eſtate for life,<note place="margin">Leaſe.</note> and the Leaſe for <hi>99</hi> years being derived out of it, when the eſtate for life ends, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate derived out of it muſt end alſo. And 2ly. If the Feme had any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpoſe of any part of the Term longer than for her life, by the ſame reaſon ſhe might have diſpoſed of all of it, which cannot be intended; for the Teſtator did not mean that ſhe ſhould have power to deſtroy the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl made upon his Daughter. And as to the Objection that ſhe hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of but part of the Term, and therefore hath not deſtroyed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl: I anſwer, It matters not what ſhe hath done, but what ſhe might have done, for by the ſame reaſon that ſhe diſpoſed of part ſhe might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the whole; The reſt of the Argument I could not hear. <hi>Henage Finch</hi> on the other ſide argued, That the Leaſe made by the Feme continues after her death, becauſe the Feme had a power given her to make ſuch a Leaſe, and by vertue of that power the Leaſe continues, for the power given unto her relates to the Eſtates to be made by her, and not to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her life. And here the intent of the Teſtator is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which was, that his wife ſhould have the power to diſpoſe of all the Term if ſhe would, for he truſted her with it, becauſe ſhe was his Wife, and Mother of his Daughter, to whom the Entayl was made, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubject, matter ſhews his intent to be ſo, and becauſe there is no other power expreſſed againſt this in any other part of the Will, and the words that give her this power would be idle and trifling if they ſhould receive any other Conſtruction, <hi>2 Car. Banc. Reg. Danyel</hi> and <hi>Ogleys</hi> caſe, and <hi>Gibs</hi> and <hi>Whites</hi> caſe, <hi>1 Car.</hi> nor does the aſſent of the Feme to the Legacy, to have the Term for life, deſtroy her power to make eſtates. 2ly. She hath well executed this power, for the Iury have found that it is the Leaſe of the Feme, <hi>9 Iac. Suckham and Hawkins</hi> caſe, a power given to an Executor may be executed by parts. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> held,<note place="margin">Leaſe.</note> the Leaſe was good; for a Will ought to be ſo interpreted, that all the parts of it may ſtand together, and if the Feme here have not power to make this Leaſe, the Clauſe of giving her this Leaſe is idle, and the meaning is ſo, without doubt the Feme hath the ſole eſtate in Law in her, and the power given here is but a reſtoring to her of that, which ſhe had before by the Law, and her conſenting to the Legacy, doth not take away her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make Eſtates. And this limited power, and the remainder to his daughter may ſtand together, for it might be that the wife would not make ſuch a leaſe, and then the daughter ſhould have had the land in tayl; but if ſhe diſpoſe of it the daughter ſhall not have it. <hi>Ierman</hi> as <hi>Roll. Nicholas Iuſtice</hi> held, that the Feme could only diſpoſe of the land during her life and that the Teſtators intent by the words was, that the Feme ſhould not be
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49377:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>tyed to occupy the lands her ſelf during her life; but might diſpoſe of them. <hi>Ask</hi> as <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that ſhe can diſpoſe of the lands only during her life, for the power is only given during her life, and this interpetation will make all parts of the Will ſtand together, better than the other interpretation. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed.

After the Leſſor levyes a fine, and aſsigneth over his intereſt in the reverſion. The queſtion here was, whether the condition of entry be transferred over to the Aſsignee, by the transferring over of the reverſion, <hi>Hales</hi> of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with the Plaintiff held that the leaſe proceeds from the Husband only, and not from the Baron and Feme, and the condition is transferred over, for the condition runs joyntly as well to the fine reſerved, as to the rent, and is as it were a ſeveral condition in Law, although it be compriſed but in one clauſe, and not ſeveral clauſes, and the condition as to the rent is transferred, though not as to the fine.

The clauſe of re-entry is within the words of the Statute; and <hi>Knights</hi> caſe objected comes not to this caſe, for there was a grant but of part of the reverſion of the land, which caſe comes not within the Statute, for the Grantor cannot have advantage by the Statute, where he grants but part of the reverſion, and it is not literally without the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and therefore it is within the equity of it, otherwiſe it would be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to the Grantor, and here is no diſadvantage to the Leſſée by the transferring of the condition, for the ſame Statute that gives benefit of the condition, gives benefit of the Covenants, and the Grantée of a rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall have benefit of a Covenant to be transferred, although they are entire in words at the beginning, and hath one common concluſion. <hi>Wild</hi> of Councel on the other ſide, held the condition to be entire, according to <hi>Rawlins</hi> caſe, and goes to payment of the rent, and the fine, and reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo, and the reverſion being aſsigned with which the rent paſſeth, the condition is gone alſo to the fine, <hi>Dyer 309.</hi> and this is a ſtronger caſe than that to deſtroy the entire condition, by grant of the reverſion, <hi>17 El.

If a <hi>ſcire facias</hi> be brought againſt the Bail, and he pleads that the Principal dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the return of the <hi>Capias</hi> againſt him, it is adjudged to be a good plea for the Bail to diſcharge himſelf;<note place="margin">Plea.</note> but to plead he dyed after the return, is not good: And it is a good plea for the Bail in a ſcire facias brought againſt him to ſay, that no <hi>capias</hi> was returned againſt the Principal; And here is a good diſcharge in Law againſt the Bail.

The queſtion here was, whether the word heirs ſhall be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the heirs of <hi>Leventhorp</hi> and <hi>Suſanna</hi> his wife, or whether the eſtate ſhall be intended to be limited to the heirs of <hi>Suſanna</hi> only, and that <hi>Leventhorp</hi> ſhall have barely an eſtate for life in the lands. <hi>Serjeant Glyn</hi> of Councel with the Plaintif held, That <hi>Suſanna Cotele</hi> hath an eſtate tayl executed in the lands, and that the word heirs ſhall relate only to the heirs of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and not to the heirs of <hi>Leventhorp, 1.</hi> Becauſe that here is an eſtate limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for life unto <hi>Suſanna</hi> by an expreſs limitation, and her heirs ſhall take im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the eſtate for life ended, and they ſhall not come in as purchaſors.

Sect. 28.</hi> There is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion of the party to whom the word heirs ſhall relate, but ſo is not here, and therefore the caſes differ. In <hi>3 Ed. 3. f. 31, 32.</hi> It is ruled that both parties have an eſtate tayl, becauſe the eſtate is limited to both, but ſo it is not in our caſe, ſo thoſe books are not againſt me. In our caſe, it doth not appear that <hi>Richard</hi> did intend to advance the Husband of <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and therefore it is not reaſon that the word heirs ſhould relate to him, but to <hi>Suſanna</hi> his wife only, for in caſe of limitation of eſtates the intention of the party is to be conſidered, and doth direct the matter, and the preceding limiting of the eſtate to <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and not to <hi>Leventhorp,</hi> doth ſhew that the party did mean to promote the heirs of <hi>Suſanna. Lit. Sect. 27. Dyer 27.</hi> A ſecond reaſon is drawn from the penning of the déed, which in the limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it doth encline more, that the word heirs ſhould be applyed to <hi>Suſanna</hi> than to <hi>Leventhorp;</hi> for the words <hi>upon her</hi> is as much as to ſay of her, and then it is the ſame caſe with <hi>Littletons</hi> caſe. <hi>3ly.</hi> The Intention of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor appears to be ſuch by the circumſtances of the entire limitations, which do ſhew that he did intend that <hi>Leventhorp</hi> ſhould not have ſuch an eſtate whereby it ſhould be in his power to deprive his iſſue, and therefore the word heirs are to be applyed to <hi>Suſanna,</hi> and not to <hi>Leventhorp;</hi> for if it ſhould be applyed to both, then <hi>Leventhorp</hi> might deſtroy the eſtate of the iſſue, contrary to the Donors intent; And whereas <hi>Dyer 99</hi> is objected againſt me.

The traverſe makes not the plea good, for the traverſe is waived, and he relyes upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, <hi>5. Car. rot. 817. Burton</hi> and <hi>Corniſh,</hi> the traverſe taken, took away the juſtification before pleaded, ſo doth it here, and the traverſe here is not good, becauſe it is in a tranſitory mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

It is the honour of this court to imaintain the jurisdiction of all other Courts and therefore I hope, it is not misbeſeeming me to put it in mind of this honour that belongs to it, I believe that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the antient Law of the land, actions ought not to be laid elſe-where, then where the matter that cauſed them did ariſe, although that now by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom it is grown otherwiſe. Although the Plaintiff may fix a tranſitory Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, where he pleaſeth in ordinary matters, yet he cannot do it where the matter ariſeth within a ſpeciall jurisdiction, as the caſe here is. It is not a good allegation that binds up the juriſdiction of this Court, except where it appears that the allegation is true, &amp; the allegation here may well ſtand with law, it being in the Caſe of a County Palatine, which hath ſuch a jurisdiction incident to it, &amp; this Court <hi>Ex Officio</hi> ought to take notice of the Iurisdiction of the County Palatine and that they have authority to hold pleas, <hi>45 Ed. 3. f. 10. 50 E. 3. pl. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And we cannot judge of the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; but by your pleading,<note place="margin">Tryall.</note> and by your traverſe you have tripped up your own heels. The reaſon why tranſitory actions may be laid in any County is, becauſe that otherwiſe juſtice might fail, for the party may do a fact in one County, and then remove to another, ſo here the party may do wrong within the County Palatine, and then go out of it to avoid juſtice.

                  <hi>HOwell Gwinn</hi> was endicted of perjury,<note place="margin">Arreſt of Iudgement in an Endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> for taking of a falſe Oath in an <hi>Affidavit</hi> made before a Maſter of the Chancery, and was found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It was moved in Arreſt of Iudgement, <hi>1.</hi> That it doth not appear by the Record that the Oath made was any thing material to the ſute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending in that Court, and ſo it is but an extrajudicial Oath, and is not perjury either by the Common Law, or by the Statute. 2ly. It doth not appear that the party took a falſe Oath, for it appears not whether the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Chancery had any power to take this Oath, and if he had not, then it cannot be perjury. <hi>Latch</hi> enforced the <hi>2</hi> Exception, and ſaid, That a Maſter of the Chancery hath not power <hi>ex Officio</hi> to take an Oath, and therefore the party ought to ſhew that he had power to take this Oath; but if he hath power he ought not to take it upon the holy Evangeliſts, as it is here expreſſed, but it ought to be upon the holy Evangely, for the form is <hi>ſuper ſacro ſancto Evangelio,</hi> and not <hi>Evangeliſtis. Maynard</hi> on the other ſide prayed judgement, and that the party may be fined, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that it doth well appear that the Oath was made touching the cauſe in queſtion, and the Endictment is here laid at the Common Law, and not upon the Statute. Next it is not neceſſary to ſhew that a Maſter of the Chancery hath authority to take an Oath, for it is the common courſe and practice of the Court of Chancery for the Maſters to take oaths, and the Chancery being a Court of Record here, this Court is bound to take notice of the Cuſtoms uſed in it. 3ly. The taking of the Oath upon the Holy Evangeliſts, and the taking of it upon the Holy Evangely is all one in effect. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> The moſt material Exception is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Maſter of the Chancery hath authority <hi>ex Officio</hi> to take an Oath, and certainly antienly he had not, and therefore you ſhould have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that he had authority to take an Oath. At another day <hi>Hales</hi> ſaid, that it doth well appear by the Record, that the Maſter had authority to take the Oath of the perſon,<note place="margin">Oath.</note> and many preſidents are, as our Caſe is. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> The Preſidents are, that he hath authority to take an Oath <hi>prout per Recordum,</hi> &amp;c. but it is not ſo expreſſed here. <hi>Nicholas Iuſtice,</hi> A Maſter of the Chancery of common right hath no power to take an Oath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Caſe you ſhould have pleaded preciſely that he had authority, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it cannot be good. <hi>Hales</hi> at another day anſwered another Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken, that it did not appear that the <hi>Affidavit</hi> in which the falſe Oath was made, was filed, and then it was not upon Record, and ſo could be no perjury, and ſaid it is all one whether the <hi>Affidavit</hi> be filed or not, for the forſwearing is before the filing, &amp; the party who takes the oath may chooſe whether he will file it or no, and therefore it is not neceſſary in the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay, as it appears by the Record. <hi>Green</hi> on the ſame ſide, It may be that it was filed, and afterwards taken off from the file, and then he cannot ſay as it appears by the Record, and it would be miſchievous if the party ſhould not be puniſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d for the perjury, becauſe the <hi>Affidavit</hi> was not filed. <hi>Serjeant Glyn</hi> on the other ſide ſaid, that the Preſidents which are ſhewn to prove that a Maſter of the Chancery may take an Oath, are, that the party hath made an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> as it appears by the Record, and this is not ſo pleaded here, and therefore the Preſidents make for us. An Endictment cannot be at the Common Law for perjury in an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> if it be not filed,<note place="margin">Filing.</note> for the filing of it makes it a ground to frame the Endict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:49377:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon, and ſo is it in other Courts, for the filing of it gives power to the Court to make rules, and orders upon it. <hi>Wild</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, that it appears not here poſitively, that the <hi>Affidavit</hi> was made in this cauſe alleged, but only by way of argument, which is not good. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> If it be in the ſame buſineſſe, it ſhall be intended to be between the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:<note place="margin">Perjury.</note> Perjury at the Common Law is intended to be in ſome Court, and legal proceedings, for a falſe oath made before us not touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion between the parties, an endictment of perjury lies not,<note place="margin">Endictment.</note> and it appears not here, that the Chancery took notice of this <hi>Affidavit,</hi> for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done upon it, and the words as it appears by the Record are material words, and do make up the buſineſſe, but they are here omitted.

To this <hi>Hales</hi> anſwered, That the Action being an Action upon the Caſe, It is not neceſſary to ſhew the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and for the four pair of hangings it is well enough, for a pair is a couple when the word is uſed of dead things, and not like a pair of tongues which make but one thing nor is it material to expreſſe of what the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are made, as it is not in an Action brought for divers pair of ſtockings material to ſay, whether they were of thread, ſilk, woſted, or wollen, as hath been adjudged, and the word hangings is certain, for any one will conceive them to be meant of hangings of a room. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> The Action is an Action upon the caſe, and it is not neceſſary to ſhew a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, for the Action is not brought for the converſion, and if it were ſo, if a demand, and a denyal be proved, doth not this prove a converſion?<note place="margin">Caſe. Trover and Conveiſion.</note> As an Action of the caſe lyes for keeping one out of poſſeſsion, although the party doth enter afterwards, and the four pair of hangings is certain enough, and it is not like as where Latin words are mingled with Engliſh in a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the words being taken in the Engliſh conſtruction ſhall be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be eight hangings. Nor is it material to expreſſe of what the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are made; But the great doubt is, whether the words be meant of hangings for a room or not, and I ſuppoſe they cannot be meant of other hangings, the words being in Engliſh, and not in Latin with an <hi>Anglice,</hi> and I believe you cannot ſhew me any thing elſe, that the words can by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intendment ſignifie. <hi>Iudicium niſi.</hi> The caſe was again moved at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day by <hi>Latch,</hi> who urged that four pair of hangings are words incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but if it had been four ſuits it had béen well, ſo that here is a miſapli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of words to expreſſe the thing meant, and he might as properly have ſaid a ſuit of Shoes, or a ſuit of Conies. If one ſay he hath loſt a hanging, this is incertain of it ſelf, for it is the predicament of <hi>ſitus</hi> and not of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for a hanging is a poſture, and the word pair makes it more incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than it was without it. <hi>Hales</hi> anſwered, that it is certain enough, for the word hanging is uſed here ſubſtantively, and not as a participle, and the common uſe of the word is only applicable to the hangings of a room, and the four pair ſhall be undeſtood eight hangings. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> A pair is properly when one of the things ſo called, cannot be properly uſed without the other; but yet the words may be alſo underſtood ſo many cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and here you cannot intend the words to mean ſo many ſuits of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and you might have expreſſed your meaning by ſo many pieces of hangings, and therefore it ſeems doubtfull. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice,</hi> Here the words do not expreſſe the number of the things, as they do when you ſay a pair of Oxen or the like. <hi>Nicholas</hi> as <hi>Ierman, Ask Iuſtice,</hi> A pair is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, for that word may be meant more than two in number, as when you ſay a pair of cards, and a pair of hangings in ſome places is meant a ſuit of hangings. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> If it be ſo, then it is more incertain, the word hangings may be good enough; but how can the number be known? <hi>Curia adviſare vult. Afterwards the Court moved the Defendant to ſuffer the Plaintiff to amend his Declaration, and to plead anew, and to conſent to a new tryall.</hi>

But <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, That the words <hi>ſince the purchaſe thereof</hi> ſeem to make this certain, <hi>yet ſtay till the other moves.</hi> At another day the caſe was moved again, and the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception inſiſted upon by <hi>Barry</hi> of the Inner Temple who formerly moved it. <hi>Hales</hi> held the Exception not good, and that the breach was well aſsigned, becauſe though it ſeem uncertain of it ſelf, yet it relates to a thing which makes it certain; As an Award for one to deliver to another all the goods in ſuch a Shop which belonged to him, hath been held to be good. But <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> anſwered, That it is utterly incertain, and that there is nothing in the Award which can make it certain, and here is a four-fold incertainty in the Award. <hi>1.</hi> It cannot be known what theſe arrears are that are awarded to be paid. 2ly. It appears not by the Award for what lands theſe arrera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of rent awarded to be paid are due, for there are no lands mentiond, but only two leaſes of land. 3ly. It appears not by whom the arrerages are due. 4ly. It appears not to whom the arrerages are due. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> All the matter is, whether it appears that theſe arrerages of rent awarded to be paid were in queſtion or no, and it ſeems they were, becauſe the leaſe and the rent thereupon reſerved are both in queſtion; but it is not certain what theſe arrears of rent are, and ſo the party that is award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay them, cannot tell what ſum of mony he is to pay. <hi>Ierman Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, he may know, becauſe he was Tenant of the land. <hi>Barry</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he cannot know when the purchaſe was made, and the arbitrement is that the party ſhall pay all the arrears ſince the purchaſe. <hi>Curia adviſare vult.</hi> At another day the caſe was again moved by <hi>Barry,</hi> and exceptions taken that the breach was aſsigned upon a thing not ſubmitted unto, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to be performed. And ſecondly. The award is incertain in many things. Firſt, It appears not what rent was due to be paid, but only by implication, which is not good. Secondly, It appears not for what the rent is due; nor 3ly. How much rent is due, and <hi>Salmons</hi> caſe, in the <hi>5. rep.</hi> was cited. Alſo it was objected that the award was not finall, and concluding, and therefore not good: Alſo the Award is unreaſonable, and for that cauſe alſo it is not good, and he cited <hi>21 E. 4. f. 40.</hi> and <hi>17 E. 4. f. 51.</hi> and prayed for the Defendant that judgement might be ſtayed. <hi>Hales</hi> on the other ſide prayed for judgement, &amp; ſaid, That the Arbitrators were not to aſcertain particularly the rent to be paid, but it is ſufficient for them to make the Award touching all the differences betwixt the parties, and an averment may aſcertain the particular things, being they are only matters of fact, although one may not be admitted by an averment to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an Award in a matter, wherein it was in the ſubſtance of it defective before, <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> What certainty is there by the Award that the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:49377:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>party ſhall enjoy all his right in the two leaſes in difference between the parties? for the payment of the rent, Both parties know what rent is due, reſerved by the leaſes, but how can the party know what the arrears are which are accrewed ſince the purchaſe?<note place="margin">Award.</note> for how can he know when the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe was made? for it is made by a ſtranger, and what if the ſtranger will not tell him when he made it? ſo that me thinks the Award is unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and then it cannot be good. <hi>The rule was, Nil capiat per Billam, Niſi, &amp;c.</hi>

The queſtion is, whether the pardon is to be allowed or not: This caſe hath been well argued, and the like caſe with this was never called into queſtion, or argued before this, and therefore if we ſhall not allow this pardon now, we have better reaſon to move us to it than others have had to do the contrary, and therefore we ſhall ſend him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country to receive Iuſtice there for his offence, for we are all of one opinion, that the pardon is not to be allowed, and that for theſe reaſons, the queſtion here is not whether the King will pardon murther; but <hi>Cook</hi> ſaith, the King will not pardon it, if he know it to be murther; but the firſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Whether he can do it with a ſpecial <hi>non obſtante.</hi> 3ly. Whether he can pardon it by this <hi>non obſtante</hi> in this Charter of pardon. 4ly. Whether <hi>Rickaby</hi> hath pleaded this <hi>non obſtante,</hi> ſo that he may take advantage of it. For the firſt point we do not abſolutely diſallow the pardon; but we are to enquire whether here be murther or not, it there be murther, that it may be diſallowed, otherwiſe that it may be allowed.<note place="margin">Murther.</note> The Statute laws were made for preſervation of the publique peace, and to reſtrain pardons for murther, ſo that after the making of the Statutes, murther could not be pardoned without a <hi>non obſtante</hi> in the pardon, though before it might have been pardoned in general words. And the Parliament hath made divers Statutes to reſtrain pardons, and that murther ſhould not be ſo generally pardoned as before. <hi>2 E. 3. 4 E. 3. 14 E. 3. 27 E. 3. C.</hi> by which Statutes it may appear, that the opinion was, that the King could not diſpence with the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes with a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> and the end of all theſe Statutes was to enform the King to examine whether the fact he intended to pardon was murther, and that he ſhould not grant a pardon for murther, without expreſsing the word murther in the pardon, and with a <hi>non obſtante</hi> alſo,<note place="margin">Non obſtante. Diſpenſation.</note>

Whether the King can pardon murther with a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> where the word murther is not expreſſed. To that I ſay, that if it had been ſo, yet the pardon would not have been good, for the Statute cannot be diſpenſed with by a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> becauſe the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was made to reform publique abuſes, for the benefit of the Common-Wealth, <hi>11. rep. Cooks Pleas of the Crown, 237.</hi> the King cannot pardon a common nuſance. 2ly. The King hath bound himſelf by expreſſe words in the Statute, and he cannot diſpence with them with a <hi>non obſtante,</hi> for then ſuch Statutes made for the advancement of juſtice would be void, and the King cannot pardon a recogniſance for the peace before it is broken, and the King may bind himſelf in ſuch manner by expreſſe words, as my <hi>Lord Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes</hi> caſe is, with the Statute of <hi>1 Iac.</hi> concerning Biſhops the King cannot diſpence, but with the Statute of <hi>1 &amp; 13 Eliz.</hi> he may. <hi>Doctor Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> caſe, <hi>Mich. 10. Iac. C. B. Hob. 103.</hi> the King cannot diſpence with this Statute, becauſe it was made for the advancement of Iuſtice. For the third point, though the King might diſpence with the Statute by a <hi>non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtante,</hi> yet not with this <hi>non obſtante</hi> in this pardon, for the King doth not take notice of the offence in the <hi>non obſtante,</hi> and the King is deceived here, which the Law will not ſuffer, and here is a hiding of the offence from the King, which is againſt the meaning of the Statute. 2ly. This manner of pardoning is againſt all manner of practiſe for two hundred years, and was never uſed till <hi>2 Iac.</hi> but only in <hi>Spencers</hi> caſe, which was carryed with a ſtrong hand, and allowed only <hi>pro hac vice, 21 Eliz.</hi> by <hi>Popham</hi> the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney general by the ſpecial command of the Queen, &amp; untill <hi>2 Iac.</hi> for <hi>200.</hi> years no <hi>non obſtante</hi> uſed of the Statute of <hi>13 R. 2.</hi> but this is grown up of late years, and a Iudge of our own times hath told me that he hath diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it. <hi>3. Inſt. 105.</hi> it hath been uſed of late times to make a leaſe of the parties life. <hi>viz.</hi> to reſpite execution untill the time of <hi>2 Iac.</hi> and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance I formerly mentioned <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> may be queſtioned whether it were good or no. For the fourth point the pleading of the pardon is not good, for he hath not pleaded a <hi>non obſtante</hi> for the pardon of the murther, but only to diſpence with the binding to the good behaviour, and the pardon is only recited to prove the plea, and therefore it is not to be allowed. <hi>Therefore let the Priſoner ire ſine die, and let the matter be inquired in the County where the fact was done.

                  </gap>eviſed unto her, or whether his Sirname ſhould be accompted a diſtinct name from the Teſtators, ſo that <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the Will could only have an Eſtate in tayl in the Lands deviſed unto her. It was argued firſt, that the name <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Mills</hi> ſhall not be ſaid to be one and the ſame name, no more than if ſhe had maried one of a clear differing Sirname in ſound, yet commonly called alſo <hi>Mills,</hi> could ſhe have been ſaid to have maried one of his own Sirname, and the Proviſo here is not a particular pointing out of the perſon whom his Daughter ſhould mary, but a general limitation
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:49377:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>directing her to mary one of his own Sirname, and this ought to have been punctually followed, becauſe the name was uſed to induce the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Deviſor to enlarge the eſtate given by him. If he had deviſed his Land to his Daughter <hi>E.</hi> if ſhe ſhall mary a Proteſtant or an Earl, ſhe muſt mary one that is really ſo, and not one called or only reputed ſo. And as to the objection, that this conſtruction would make contrariety in the Will, which is not to be admitted; this will not be, if the Will be taken <hi>compoſitive</hi> as it is penned, or together, and not <hi>abſtractive</hi> and taken to pieces, and if it ſhould not be intended that ſhe ſhould mary one who in truth was of his name there would be a contradiction in the Will; and here is an Emphaſis in the word <hi>Own,</hi> which muſt be meant his real name, and not of a reputative name. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> If a Iuror be retorned by the name of <hi>Mills,</hi> and is ſworn by the name of <hi>Mill,</hi> ſhall this be a miſtryal, <hi>quaſi non?</hi> and the words found alike as <hi>Baxter</hi> and <hi>Backſter.</hi> At an other day the Caſe was put again by <hi>Hales,</hi> and argued for the Plaintiff, and he made divers points in the Caſe, but I could not well hear him: but the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point inſiſted on was the point formerly ſpoken to, and the ſum of his Argument was, that we are in this Caſe upon the conſtruction of a Will, which muſt be favourably taken, and the variation here betwixt <hi>Mills</hi> and <hi>Mill</hi> is ſmall and inconſiderable to defeat an Eſtate, for it is only in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the word, and is as little as the difference between <hi>Baxter</hi> and <hi>Backſter,</hi> or <hi>Haſting</hi> and <hi>Haſtings, 9 E. 4.42, 44 Eliz. Molyn</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyns,</hi> or <hi>Pitt</hi> and <hi>Pitts,</hi> which differ but in one letter, and is not a material difference. 2ly. It appears by the Verdict that he was commonly called <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Mills,</hi> and common reputation we know doth give names to things. 3ly. It is found that he was known by one name as well as the other, and this will ſatisfie the Teſtators intent well enough to carry the Eſtate. 4ly. The party himſelf was known to the Teſtator at the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Will by the name of <hi>Mills,</hi> as appears in eight ſeveral places of the Will. And if one deviſe Lands and Goods, and excepts one Leaſe, if there be other Leaſes they are deviſed. 5ly. It appears by the Will and the Verdict, that the mariage was intended by the Father with this very perſon that is called <hi>Mills,</hi> and a ſettlement of Lands made upon it, and it ſhall not be intended that the Teſtator thought that this mariage would be diſſolved and another mariage be had. And the deviſe in the body of the Will doth not make the Proviſo in the end of the Will repugnant, but if it did the laſt repugnancy ſhall ſtand: for here is no dependancy of the laſt Proviſo upon the other part of the Will, but it is a ſubſtantine clauſe which revokes not the other, Doctor <hi>Buts</hi> Caſe, <hi>10 Rep.</hi> and this ſhall be counted his laſt Will, and it is the more ſtrong, becauſe it appears by the very words, that it is a plain ſubſtantive clauſe made to declare the new intent of the Teſtator, and it ſhall not be intended that this Proviſo ſhall be applyed to another perſon, although there be a particular title given to him by the Will, and the Eſtate altered by the Proviſo, and the former deviſe is derogated by it, <hi>Hob.</hi> 2d. Caſe, <hi>Harding</hi> Caſe, and the ſtrength of the Proviſo to have one of the true name of <hi>Mills</hi> is not to be intended, for it appears that the intent of the Teſtator was, to have one of his name in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and this appears by the former limitation in the Will, and the proviſion made in the laſt Proviſo to preſerve his name, is no more than that he had done before: and the former limitation is as well for the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtators advantage as the latter Proviſo, and more, and his intent was not to ſell the Lands, but to preſerve them, and it is no more to ſay of my own <hi>Sirname,</hi> than to ſay <hi>of my Sirname,</hi> nor is the <hi>videlicet</hi> any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> if the queſtion were only upon the Proviſo, there would be no difficulty but that <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Mills</hi> ſhould be all one, and it would
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:49377:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>be good in a Conveyance alſo, as I ſuppoſe, and if it were apparent that he intended one and the ſame perſon,<note place="margin">Proviſo.</note> then the laſt Proviſo would be good to revoke the former part of the Will: but the doubt is, whether he intend the ſame perſon or not, becauſe he makes ſuch an alteration of the Eſtate by the Proviſo, and puts theſe words <hi>mine own name</hi> in it, by which it ſéems he intended to advance his own name, and he ſeems exact in it by the great alteration of the Eſtate made by the Proviſo in the ſettlement of the Eſtate. At another day the Caſe was again moved and argued by <hi>Wadham Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> that <hi>Mills</hi> &amp; <hi>Mill</hi> are both one name, and differ but in ſound, as <hi>Abacock</hi> &amp; <hi>Habacock,</hi> and the Verdict finds that both the names are his true Sirname, though it could not be ſo in Chriſtian names, <hi>6 Rep. 66.</hi> Sirnames are altered by time and Cuſtom of places, and being ſo altred do become true names, as the name of <hi>Cromwell.</hi> is now become a true name, though antiently the name was <hi>Williams;</hi> but I agree, that Chriſtian names cannot be altered by time, no more than things can be altered from one thing to another. 3ly. By the conſtruction of the Will, and by the finding of the Verdict, the names are made one name, although by the Teſtator he was known by no other name than the name of <hi>Mills,</hi> for he is ſo called, and this anſwers the Proviſo in the Will, that he ſhould be of his own Sirname with whom his Daughter was to mary. 4ly. Here is a particular deviſe made to her in the body of the Will of the Lands, if they ſhould not be deviſed here, <hi>8 Rep. Clauſa generalia non extendunt ad ea quae ſunt ſpecialiter recitata;</hi> and there is a difference between a Will and a Deed, for all the words in a Deed are ſpoken together: but it is not ſo in a Will which is ambulatory, and may have ſeveral conſtructions, and one clauſe may controll another, <hi>Inſtit. 11 2.</hi> and the Proviſo here in the laſt part of the Will controlls the former part of the Will, as a <hi>Codicil</hi> might have done, if there had been any, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words expreſs the parties meaning, <hi>1 Rep. Porters</hi> Caſe, <hi>Dyer 255.</hi> If in a Will a clauſe may receive a doubtfull conſtruction, then a <hi>verbis non eſt recedendum,</hi> nor ſhall there be a particular ſupplyment of words added to expound it, except to prevent an abſurdity, which muſt not be admitted, though in a Will. <hi>Maynard</hi> on the other ſide made two queſtions. <hi>1.</hi> Whether <hi>Mills</hi> and <hi>Mill</hi> ſhould be intended to be one and the ſame Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, and ſo to be the Teſtators Sirname. 2ly. Whether <hi>Elizabeth</hi> take the Lands by the firſt clauſe in the Will, or by the Proviſo or latter clauſe. For the firſt he held, that <hi>Mills</hi> and <hi>Mill</hi> is not one and the ſame Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, becauſe the Teſtator had a particular eye to his own true Sirname, and the Caſes put of names that differ, yet ſound alike, do not come to our Caſe, becauſe there was no ſuch ſpecial eye or regard as here is, 2ly. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that his true name be <hi>Mills,</hi> and that he is provided for particularly by the Teſtator in his Will, then the Proviſo cannot extend to him, for this would be ſenſeleſſe, and it is as much as to make the Teſtator in one breath to ſpeak contradictories, and it would be hard to make ſuch conſtructions of ſuch words that would argue the party to be irrational that ſpake them, and the words in the Proviſo are in nature of an exception in conſtruction of Law, <hi>12 Ed. 1. Fitzh. Grants 87.</hi> and <hi>Carter</hi> and <hi>Ringſteeds</hi> Caſe is not yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the other ſide, <hi>Bolton and the Lady Staffords caſe, 8 Iac. C. B. 1. rep. Mildmayes</hi> Caſe. The words in a Proviſo in a Will or Deed may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with other words, rather than to interpret it ſo, that it ſhall contradict the former part of the Will or Deed where it is, and by the conſtruction that we make of the Proviſo all the Will may ſtand together, but by another conſtruction it cannot. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhall have a ſpecial entayl with her Husband by the laſt clauſe, and yet the general Eſtate tayl given in the former part ſhall ſtand; and we are in the interpretation of Wills to conſider cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and conjectures, and there are two publications found in this
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:49377:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>will, although this doth not appear upon Record, and ſo comes not in judgement. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice, We are all of one opinion, that judgement ought to be given for the Defendant.</hi> If the firſt clauſe in the Will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue uncontrolled by the Proviſo, it is for the Defendant, but if it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not uncontrolled it is for the Plaintif, and we hold that the firſt clauſe is not controlled, for we ought not to make any part of a Will void, if all the parts of it may ſtand together, and this cannot be here if the Proviſo ſhould controll the former part,<note place="margin">Revocation.</note> and to make it repugnant, but if the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo could ſtand with the former part of the Will it might revoke the former part, and if this Proviſo had been made after the Will, it might have altered the Caſe, but that appears not; And we muſt collect the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors meaning by the Will,<note place="margin">Intention.</note> and by the Will it cannot be underſtood that the Proviſo ſhould be void, and the common reputation of <hi>Mill</hi> and <hi>Mills</hi> to be the ſame name, ſhall not make <hi>Mill</hi> to be the Teſtators true Sirname, and the Teſtator intended his Daughter ſhould marry one of his own true Sirname, and not one of his reputative name, for this is a ſpecial caſe, and goes not according to the ordinary rules of names that ſound alike, and it cannot be intended that the Teſtator did mean to deſtroy one part of his will by another part. A general clauſe in a grant ſhall not extend to a particular thing provided for in the grant, much leſs ſhall it do ſo in a Will. <hi>Therefore let judgement be for the Defendant, niſi.</hi>

It had been good to have ſhewn the preciſe day of taking forth the Original, but it is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to do it, and this is not like the miſ-pleading of a Statute which muſt be preciſely pleaded and is matter of ſubſtance: but this is matter of form only, and beſides this matter is here waived, and nothing is ſhewed by the Plaintiff which can bar him of his Action,<note place="margin">Demurrer.</note> nor hath the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleaded any thing to bar him. And by the replication you have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Defendant to plead to you, for you have concluded <hi>ad patriam,</hi> and ſtopped him from proceeding further in pleading: but the principal matter is, that you have waived the matter pleaded in bar, of which you might have taken advantage, and I conceive that he who demurs upon matter of form ought to ſhew the ſpecial matter wherefore he demurs:<note place="margin">Advantage.</note> but if it be waived by the other by his replying, he ſhall not afterwards take advantage for the not ſhewing it, notwithſtanding the Statute, and divers opinions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for the Statute enjoyneth to ſet forth the matter of form pleaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiently. <hi>Nil capiat per billam, niſi.</hi>

The Plaintif in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not declare that the Defendant was made Executrix, and if ſhe be but Executrix <hi>de ſon tort demeſne,</hi> ſhe is not liable to this Action. <hi>Wadham Windham</hi> on the other ſide held, that the words yielding and paying in the Leaſe are an expreſs Covenant, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At another day <hi>Windham</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that the Action was well brought, becauſe this is an expreſs Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and not a Covenant in Law. 2ly. It is not material to ſhew how ſhe is made Executrix; and for the firſt this muſt be an expreſs Covenant, becauſe it is by Indenture, although the word Covenant be not expreſſed, for that word is not a word of Art, and ſo not eſſential to the conſtituting of a Covenant, <hi>Dyer 57.27 E. 4. f. 6.</hi> And for the ſecond it is well ſet forth, that ſhe is made Executrix, for it is ſaid ſhe entred as an Executrix: 2ly. She hath admitted herſelf to be Executrix by pleading. <hi>Latch</hi> on the other ſide held, That here is only a Covenant in Law, and ſo is the book in <hi>Dyer</hi> cited by <hi>Windham,</hi> and the Executrix is not bound here, becauſe it is againſt the Aſsignee of a Term, and the very words doe ſhew that here is no expreſs Covenant, for the words yielding and paying are not the words of the Leſſee, but only by conſtruction of Law, but are the words of the Leſſor enjoyning the Leſſee to pay the rent. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> How
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:49377:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>prove you that this Action lies not againſt an Aſsignee? <hi>Latch</hi> The caſe of <hi>Overton</hi> &amp; <hi>Sidney</hi> proves it, for it proves that Debt lies not, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence Covenant lies not. And for the ſecond matter, the Defendant is not intitled to the leaſe in privity, becauſe it is not ſhewed that ſhe is made Executrix, and ſo ſhe ſhall be taken but as an Executrix of her own wrong, and ſo is not chargeable, becauſe ſhe hath no privity of eſtate but by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor is it any where ever mentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed that any can be Executrix <hi>de ſon tort</hi> of a Term. 2ly. She cannot be a Termor, but ſhe muſt be a Diſſeiſereſs, for ſhe cannot apportion her own wrong. 3ly. She cannot make a title to the Term by her entry, as it may be by a <hi>que eſtate,</hi> and therefore it is againſt reaſon that ſhe ſhall be a Termor, and there is no authority againſt this, <hi>Paſch. 25 Eliz.</hi> in this Court. <hi>King and Burges</hi> in <hi>Mores</hi> Reports <hi>Dyer 254.</hi> Vpon a Demurrer, adjudged that it was not ſhewed how one was Executor. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> What ſay you to the Objection, that the Action is brought againſt you as an Executrix, and you appear and plead, and ſo admit your ſelf to be an Executrix? And I hold that here is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Covenant, for the words are the agreement of both parties to the Indenture, and then the Executor is chargeable by them, and it is not like to the Caſe of a Demiſe, and there is no difference here between a Covenant in Law, and an expreſs Covenant, becauſe it is touching a thing which ariſeth from the land, and ſo the Aſsignee is bound by it, and this Caſe is not like the caſe cited out of <hi>Dyer,</hi> for there the eſtate was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but here it continues. And as to the laſt point, I conceive <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma facie,</hi> that ſhe ſhall be accompted a true Executrix; and you by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have admitted it; and if one enter as an. Executor upon a Term, he may have the Term if the other will admit him to be a Termor, and he ſhall not be accompted a Diſſeiſor to the Leſſor, and to ſtrangers he ſhall be accompted an Executor in Law, if they bring Actions againſt him, and the Term ſhall be aſſets in his hands; As if one receive my rent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my conſent, I may charge him as my receiver,<note place="margin">Aſſets.</note> or make him a diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor at my election. <hi>Curia ad idem, and ſo the Iudgement was affirmed.</hi> But afterwards it was moved again, and the writ of Error was quaſhed for a variance betwixt it and the Record, for the Record is againſt the Aſsigns, and the writ of Error is to remove a Record againſt the Aſsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nee. <hi>Poſtea.</hi>

The queſtion was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this deviſe was warranted by the Cuſtom. <hi>Shafto</hi> argued, that the Cuſtom did not warrant this deviſe, becauſe Cuſtoms are not to be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by conſtruction, but are to be taken ſtrictly, and according to the letter, becauſe they run in abridgement of the Common-law, and ſo are not to be favoured, <hi>9 E. 3. f. 38.11 H. 4. f. 33.5. H. 6. f. 51.</hi> Next here are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material words found in the Verdict, for if it be the Cuſtom for Tenant in fee-ſimple to deviſe, yet this extends not to tenant in tayl, <hi>27 H. 6. f. 5.21.

An eſtate in remainder is not Aſſets, nor can be deviſed, <hi>3 H. 7. f. 23, 24.</hi> a condition goes to an Eſtate. tayl, not to a fée-ſimple in remainder, <hi>6 Rep. f. 33.</hi> And here is but a power of an Eſtate, and not an Eſtate in poſſeſsion, <hi>Lit. ſect. 137.</hi> And the finding here that the Tenant in tayl did die without iſſue is not material, for this could not be known at the time of the deviſe, and the deviſe takes its effect in the time of the Deviſor, <hi>27 H. 8.

Dyer 22.22 Eliz, 371. p. 5.</hi> and the Cuſtom here found is no more, but an ordinary Cuſtom common to other Boroughs, and it ſhall not be intended a ſpecial Cuſtom. And this caſe may be reſembled to Caſes upon the Statute of <hi>32, &amp; 34 H. 8.</hi> for deviſing of Lands, <hi>10 Rep. f. 81. Trin. 34 Eliz. Benefilds</hi> Caſe there cited and <hi>35 Eliz.

At another day it was argued, that the deviſe was not good, for the word <hi>Owners</hi> cannot extend to all ſorts of Owners, for it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not to an Infant Owner of ſuch Houſes, for he cannot deviſe,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:49377:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>therefore the words muſt receive a limited conſtruction, and therefore I conceive the word <hi>Owner</hi> extends only to an abſolute Tenant in fee-ſimple, and not to a reverſioner in fee: for a Cuſtom muſt, as hath been ſaid, be taken ſtrictly, <hi>12 E. 4. f. 3.21 E. 4. f. 24.</hi> 2ly. In true conſtruction this Owner in fee in remainder ſhall not be ſaid Owner, but the Tenant in tayl is Owner, and ſo here is not Owner <hi>ex vi termini.</hi> 3ly. Here is but a poſsibility of fee-ſimple in him, which is not grantable or deviſable, <hi>2 Ed. 4.1.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2d. helps not to the Cuſtom: for that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is within memory of man, <hi>26 H. 8. f. 4.22 Aſſ. Pl. 78.</hi> And upon the very finding of the verdict it cannot be good, for by the Verdict no title is found for the Defendant. <hi>Latch</hi> on the other ſide held, that here is a good deviſe warranted by the Cuſtom, for here is an Eſtate within the very let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Cuſtom, for he is true Owner of the Houſe in fee-ſimple, although it be not in preſent poſſeſsion, for he hath fee-ſimple in it, and hath it to his own benefit in ſuch an Eſtate as it is, and the word <hi>Owner</hi> is a general word, and comprehendeth all manner of Ownerſhips. 2ly. It is within the reaſon of the Cuſtom, for it intends the ſame benefit to Owners in reverſion as it doth to Owners in poſſeſsion, and is indifferent unto all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. And although a Cuſtom ſhall be taken ſtrictly, yet it ſhall alſo be taken reaſonably, as having reſpect to the benefit of the party, and there can be no reaſon alleged to be againſt this deviſe; <hi>26 H. 8.4.</hi> A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in fee ſhall go according to the Cuſtom, whether by the Cuſtom Lands in fee ſhall go, the Cuſtom ſhall go to all things iſſuing out of the Land, and ſo to all Eſtates in the Land, <hi>Dyer 148.</hi> and here is more than a poſsibility deviſed, <hi>4 &amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mar.

That he ought not to plead it by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, for this plea is not a plea to the jurisdiction of the Court, but it is only a prayer to the Court, and he might have done it <hi>ore tenus,</hi> and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by Attorney his plea cannot be entred, for then the plea of privilege would be deſtroyed in making him to attend. Every one by the Common Law ought to appear in perſon, and there is no Statute, Law nor uſage that authoriſeth an Attorney to make an Attorney to demand his privilege. 2ly. It is againſt the dignity of this Court that he ſhould be admitted to do it. 3ly. By making of an Attorney he deſtroys the very reaſon why he claims his privilege, which is to be ſpared of his attendance, which he needs not if he make an Attorney, and his making of an Attorney here is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral warrant to defend other cauſes as well as this, and the Caſe of an

The queſtion was, whether this was a good cuſtom or not. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyn</hi> argued for the cuſtom, that it was a good cuſtom; becauſe ſuch cuſtoms are not to be governed by the rules of the Common Law, but by the rules of natural reaſon, and are conſiderable in themſelves, and ſuch cuſtoms may reſtrain the Common Law, and the Common Law doth tollerate them.

This Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was not countermandable by the Copyholder himſelf during his life, and therefore it ſhall not be countermanded by his death, and though it had been countermandable during his life, yet it being not countermanded by him in his life, his death ſhall not countermand it, and the cuſtom doth ſtrengthen this power. Next, this cuſtom is not contradictory, for here is no Attorney made, but a writing made in the nature of a Letter of Attorney, and a power to ſurrender given by it, and it is no more than for one Copyholder to ſurrender for another, which is uſual, and in <hi>Cooks 9 Rep. f. 76.</hi> A Copyholder is called an Attorney; alſo Copyhold eſtates are made by cuſtoms, and therefore ſuch cuſtoms which are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm eſtates are to be favoured in Law, although they do differ from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances of eſtates at the Common Law, and this cuſtom is not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but convenient alſo for the paſsing of Copyhold eſtates. And this cuſtom enlarges the power of alienations, and ſuch cuſtoms have general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been admitted good, though different from the Common Law; And when a cuſtom is become a Law it is very dangerous to alter it, and the doing of it would overthrow many eſtates. <hi>Ellis Sollicitor General</hi> on the other ſide argued, That the cuſtom is not good, becauſe it is againſt the rule of Law, That an authority given ſhould ſurvive the party that gave it, and a cuſtom cannot ſtrengthen it, for a cuſtom ought to be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and agreeing to the nature of the thing which it concerns, otherwiſe it cannot be good, for <hi>Ratio eſt formalis cauſa conſuetudinis, Daliſons Rep. 32. 1 Inſtit. f. 59.</hi> And this cauſe cannot be reaſonable, becauſe it cannot give an authority to another to do ſuch a thing for him after his death, which he could not do during his life; And this cuſtom doth purely deſtroy the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Common Law, and therefore cannot be good; And it is againſt the very nature of an authority to ſurvive, and ſo conſequently it is againſt the nature of the thing, <hi>Dyer 357. 10 E. 3. f. 5. 18 Rep. Vnyers</hi> caſe. The party in his life time might have revoked this authority, and therefore his death doth revoke it; and by the death of the Copyholder the Copyhold is deſcended, and cannot be ſurrendred by a dead man, and here was no
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:49377:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>incoation of the eſtate of the party that is dead, and I hold there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt a will and an authority; And alſo here the Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not purſuant to the cuſtom, and therefore it is a void Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>16 Iac. rot. 530.

Bray</hi> and <hi>Humes</hi> caſe, and <hi>4 Iac. Cars</hi> and <hi>Rans</hi> caſe, and <hi>Hill. 14 Iac. Snails</hi> caſe, and <hi>20 Iac. Curle</hi> and <hi>Tucks</hi> caſe. 2ly. Here is no averment that <hi>Whitwick</hi> during whoſe life he claims the office was alive when the words were ſpoken, and if he were dead then he was no officer. And the ſubſequent words do qualifie the former part of the words, for the receiving of the mony is not an offence or coſening of the State, <hi>14 Iac. Godard</hi> and <hi>Gilberts</hi> caſe in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas, and for the word <hi>foiſting</hi> it is an inſenſible word,<note place="margin">Inſenſible word.</note> and therefore cannot be actionable, and the Plaintif doth not aver, that he did not foiſt in words into this order,<note place="margin">No Action where no dammages.</note> but only ſayes, he did not foiſt in words into any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                     </gap>ton</hi> knew him to be ſo, and ſo here is an ill induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:49377:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Sir <hi>Miles Fleetwoods</hi> caſe is, that he ought to know that he was an Officer, and there the words were poſitive and certain, but ſo they are not here, nor do relate to his Office and the words are to be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they lye together, and ſo ſome of them are of a very ambiguous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and uncertain, and others of them are inſenſible, and an averment cannot make ſenſeleſs words to be ſenſe. And in the caſe of <hi>Curle</hi> and <hi>Tuck, 20 Iac.</hi> no judgement was ever given, and yet that was ſtronger than our caſe. It was alſo urged by <hi>Powis</hi> on the ſame ſide, that it appears not that the mony ſpoken of did belong to the State, or was to be compounded for, for it may be he received the monies before he was a Delinquent, and then he was not to compound for them, <hi>Hob. 3.23. Bradſhaw</hi> and <hi>Walkers</hi> caſe cited. Sergeant <hi>Twiſden</hi> for the Plaintif held the words to be action<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and cited <hi>8 Car. Culme</hi> and <hi>Denhams</hi> caſe, where it was adjudged, that to ſay a man was a <hi>coſening Knave</hi> are actionable words, and <hi>16 Iac.</hi> Sir <hi>VVilliam Brunkers</hi> caſe, and <hi>Hill. 1651 Strode</hi> and <hi>Homes</hi> caſe in this Court, and <hi>Trin. 1653. Towneſend</hi> and <hi>Barkers</hi> caſe; and in this Caſe is an inſtancing wherein the Plaintif hath coſened which makes it more plain, and it is alſo aggravated by ſaying he had coſened, the State, for he hath thereby incenſed the State againſt the Plaintif; and the words in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſcandalous and prejudicial alſo, for if he hath not compounded he is no Officer, but hath loſt his Office, being lyable to be ſequeſtred, and the words here, ſhall be taken <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> and not in <hi>ſenſu diviſo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Senſus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus et ſenſus diviſus.</note> for they are poſitive words, <hi>8 Car. Redwood</hi> &amp; <hi>Smiths</hi> caſe, and the laſt words are only ſpoken to inſtance the Cauſe of ſpeaking of the former, and it is not material whether they be actionable or not, but the meaning of the word <hi>foiſting</hi> is not ſo doubtfull, but is very well known, and ſhall be intended that he had falſely put in words into the order, and ſo they are ſcandalous as well as the former, <hi>5 Car. Alleyns</hi> Caſe. And there is no neceſsity here to aver the life of <hi>VVhitwick</hi> as is objected on the other ſide, for the Office was for the life of <hi>Henly</hi> and <hi>VVhitwick,</hi> and the ſurviver of them, and if the averment were neceſſary in ſome Caſes, yet here it is not, becauſe <hi>Whitwick</hi> is an Officer upon Record in this Court, where the Action is brought, and ſeen to be alive here in Court; and beſides, the Statute of <hi>21 Iac.</hi> would help this if need required, it being after a verdict, and not upon a demurrer; and beſides, here is an averment, that he hath not foiſted words into this order in effect, for he hath averred, that he hath not foiſted words into any order, and ſo conſequently not into this, <hi>2 R. 3. f. 7. 12 H. 7. f. 23.</hi> And the Act of oblivion hath not pardoned this offence, as is alſo objected, and though it ſhould, yet it muſt be pleaded, that the party may appear not to be excepted ont of it, as many are, and the Iury have here found for the Plaintif, and ſo it ſhall be intended that he is out of the Act, and he ought to have averred it before, or have given it in evidence, and ſo he prayed judgement for the Plaintif. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> you miſtake the exception, for they ſay that Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> is pardoned by the Act, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be damnified by the words if they were true, and ſo they are not actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Twiſden,</hi> By their pleading it appears not, that Mr. <hi>Henly</hi> is within the pardon, for there are many perſons excepted out of it. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> But if it be ſo, yet if the words do not relate to him as an Officer they are not actionable. <hi>Wild,</hi> The words are ſpoken intentionally in relation to his Office. <hi>Roll chief Iuſtice,</hi> He was not an Officer at the time of the words ſpoken, for he was ſequeſtred, and then what ſcandal can they be to him. <hi>Wild,</hi> The Iury hath found that he was damnified, though the words were true. The firſt queſtion here is, whether the words, as they are laid, relate to his Office, for he is not an Officer, nor can the Action be brought by him as he is ſo, but this is not much to the purpoſe: but the deceit alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:49377:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be done to the State charged upon him is the cauſe of the Action, and it is ſaid that he deceived the State in his compoſition, for his fine, and for foiſting words into the order, and if he foiſted not any words into any order then he did it not into this.<note place="margin">Averment.</note> And there is no need to aver <hi>Whitwicks</hi> life, for he could not receive the profits of the Office if <hi>Whitwick</hi> were dead, and therefore he ſhall be intended to he alive; and there doth dammage ariſe to the Plaintif by the ſpeaking of the words, for he is in danger thereby of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration by ſuch foiſting of the words; and in the common underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words they ſhall be taken to be meant of falſifying of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees order, and one man ought not to ſlander another; and ſay that you had not notice of the Ordinance touching which he is ſlandered, it is not to the purpoſe, for you ought to take notice of the Ordinance. <hi>Newdigate Iuſtice,</hi> to the ſame effect, that the words are actionable, for as they are laid, <hi>Henly</hi> is brought therby within the compaſs of Sequeſtration, and the words in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are actionable, becauſe they inſtance in what thing he coſened the State, and the ſubſequent words do not qualifie the former, but ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the matter,<note place="margin">Iudgement for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiff.</note> and I conceive it not neceſſary to aver <hi>Whitwicks</hi> life, but if it be, it is averred here; <hi>and ſo judgement was given for the Plaintif, niſi, &amp;c.</hi>

It was alſo ſaid by him, that if Copies of Court Rolls be ſhewed to prove a Cuſtomary eſtate, the enjoynment of ſuch eſtates muſt alſo be proved, otherwiſe the proof is not good.

That he neglected to hold Courts whereby cauſes could not be tried, to the prejudice of many. <hi>Latch</hi> of Councel with <hi>Bernardiſton</hi> to the firſt cauſe anſwered, That although it was an Error in Iudgement to deny the Clergy where it ſhould have been granted; yet this was not committed as he was Recorder of the Town, but as a Commiſsioner of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> which was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but for a year, and was a diſtinct power from his power as he was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, and executed by him, with other Commiſsioners that were joyned with him in Commiſsion. To the ſecond he anſwered, that here doth not appear to be any prejudice to any by his not holding the Seſsions, nor that there was any cauſe to hold them, and beſides, it doth appear, that the Seſsions where he neglected to ſit were not legally appointed to be held, for they were appointed by them that had no authority to do it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:49377:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>by the Maior and Baylifs, whereas they ought to be appointed by the Maior, Baylifs, and Recorder; and next the Iuſtices are miſ-named, for they are called the Iuſtices of the Borough, whereas they ought to be called the Iuſtices of the King. 4ly. Here doth not appear any appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all of the Quarter Seſsions. To the 3d. he anſwered, that it is not neceſſary that he ſhould appoint a Barreſter to be Deputy-Recorder, and to ſay that he was not fit to be Deputy-Recorder is too general a charge, but it ought to be ſhewed in what he was unfit, and his contracting with him for mony concerns not the Coporation, neither is it malum in ſe, but is only puniſhable by the Statute of <hi>5 Ed. 6.</hi> And as to the laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> his neglecting to try the iſſues joyned at the daies appointed it is not a crime material to deprive him of his free hold, and few Stewards do otherwaies, for they do uſually ſtay till they have a competent number of Cauſes to try, before they will ſit; and here are but ſix cauſes alleged to be untryed, and one of them was not tryable in that place, nor is it averred, that he had notice given him of any iſſues to be tryed, and ſo the offence is the leſs, <hi>5 Rep. Semaignes</hi> caſe, nor doth it appear, that any tryal was diſappointed by his abſence, for it appears not that there was any iſſues joyned, or any warning given for tryal in any of the Cauſes during the time alleged, wherein it is ſaid he did for bear to ſit to try them. Laſtly, here is no juſt way of proceeding to deprive him of his place though he might be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for he was never ſummoned to appear to anſwer the matters objected againſt him, as he ought to have been, and ſo is <hi>Cook</hi> in Sir <hi>James Baggs</hi> caſe. <hi>Sergeant Glyn</hi> on the ſame ſide inſiſted only upon the laſt matter ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>Latch,</hi> which he ſaid went through the whole Caſe. <hi>Roll chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> He ought to have been heard, how elſe can it be known whether they had juſt cauſe to remove him or not, and it is very hard to deprive one of his free-hold without hearing him make his defence. The Court was moved at another day for their opinion, and then Sergeant <hi>Twiſden</hi> endeavoured to anſwer ſome exceptions taken to the retorn by <hi>Windham,</hi> and to make good the exceptions taken againſt <hi>Bernardiſton,</hi> much to the ſame effect as formerly. <hi>Whereupon Roll chief Juſtice</hi> anſwered, you ought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him before you had put him out, that you might have heard what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe he could make for his abſence, elſe how can it be known, whether he had a juſt cauſe of abſence or not. <hi>Therefore let him be reſtored, niſi,</hi>

And within the body of the Act, there are no Acts expreſſed, but having a weapon drawn againſt him, or being firſt ſtruck, and this enumeration of the Acts excludes all other, as it is in the Statute of Fines, and in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute which takes away Clergy.

The Statute intended to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the killing of men ſuddenly, which is the worſt of all other killing, for it is as it were to deſtroy not only the body, but even to kill body and ſoul alſo, and therefore though the Statute be penal, yet it is not to be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably interpreted, it being made for the peace and quiet of the Nation. The killing is the matter aimed at in the Statute, and it matters not whether the party be killed with a Fancheon or a Piſtol, as <hi>Williams</hi> caſe was, that killed another by throwing a Taylors Gooſe at him, and he is not within the ſaving of the Statute though he was aſſaulted, and the other ſtood with the ſword in the ſcabbard in his hand, <hi>36, 37 Eliz. Hanger and Molins</hi> caſe in the Exchequer Chamber, The words of the Statute are, not being firſt ſtrook, but an aſſault is not a ſtriking, and ſo he is out of the Letter of the Statute, and here was no weapon drawn, for the ſword was in the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, which is no more than a ſtaff in a mans hand, <hi>Stat. 5 E. 6.

This is a good Law, and to be interpreted ſtrictly, yet I hold the priſoner is not within it; for the ſcope of the Statute appears by the preamble, the body, and ſaving of it, which do all confirm my opinion: My firſt reaſon is, becauſe I find that the intent of the Statute is againſt ſudden killing, but here was nor a ſudden killing, and the Statute takes not away the Clergy from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Manſlaughter, and here was a Treſpaſs and an impriſnoment acted

The body of the act ſeems to mean, that there ought to be malice in the caſe, and it doth not intend we ſhould ſtick to the very words of it; and here the party ſlain might have forſéen the danger, and defended himſelf. 3ly The proviſo excepts divers particulars out of the Law, and the word killing is only in the <hi>proviſo,</hi> ſo that there is proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made how the Statute ſhall be interpreted, <hi>viz.</hi> That it muſt be ſudden killing, which is not ſo here, for there ſo provocations, and time interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient betwixt them and the ſtabbing, and the Verdict finds no praeconceived malice, and the Statute extends to no other killing by the <hi>proviſo.</hi> And if one be aſſaulted by Theeves which have no ſword drawn, and the party aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted ſtabs one of the Theeves, he is not within the intent of the Statute, although he be within the words of it, or if one be aſſaulted in his houſe, and the Aſſaultor hath no weapon drawn, and one of the Aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors be ſhot, yet the party aſſaulted is not within the Statute, <hi>15 Car.</hi> in <hi>Davy</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> caſe it was adjudged by all the Iudges that he that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another by throwing a Hammer at him was not within the Statute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a preceding provocation of him.

And by the Law of God I find no difference betwéen Murther and Manſlaughter, for it makes no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwéen hot blood and cold blood, as we do now diſtinguiſh; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word in the Statute me thinks doth take away the Clergy by way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, even from the title of the Act to the very end of it, and here is a great ſin to be puniſhed, and great inconveniences would follow to admit of the Clergy in ſuch caſes as this is, and here was a ſudden killing as the act expreſſeth, for it was done with a dagger which was not ſéen, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly drawn out of a pocket, and no weapon was drawn againſt him, for the provocations alleged, they cannot amount to the drawing of a weapon, or ſuch a provocation as the Statute intends, for all the acts done by <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> amounted but to a Treſpaſs, and cannot be ſuch a provocation as ſhould cauſe <hi>Buckner</hi> to fear his death, for no violence was uſed to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by ſtriking, or drawing of a weapon, or other ways, and the ſending for Bailifs to arreſt him cannot be ſuch a provocation as the Statute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, which is to put the party in fear of his life, and the party knew that <hi>Horwood</hi> came with an intent only to arreſt him, and not to kill him, nor did the party ſlain do any thing againſt <hi>Buckner</hi> to provoke him; and there is by preſumption of Law a prepenſed malice in <hi>Buckner</hi> to kill <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> which is ſéen by his ſudden manner of ſtabbing him, and <hi>Davye</hi>

But <hi>Green</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that though it was not ſo expreſſed, yet it ſhould be intended that he had not accompted for all ſuch monies as he had received of the Cuſtomers in his charge, and as to another exception which was alſo formerly taken, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Plaintif had not ſhewed what monies he had received, for which the Defendant had not accompted, and ſo he knew not what anſwer to give, <hi>Green</hi> anſwered, that the Plaintif is not bound to ſhew it preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he cannot tell what the Defendant had received, and what not, but the Defendant doth know it well enough. <hi>Glyn chief Iuſtice,</hi> I doubt of that, for the Plaintif muſt know that the Defendant hath received ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

<pb n="478" facs="tcp:49377:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>writ, and therein ſet forth at large there Charter and privileges of the Town, and the cauſe of the diſfranchiſement of <hi>Yates</hi> and the others, and reaſons why they were not to be reſtored. And by the retorn the matter of fact for which they were disfranchiſed appeared to be in ſubſtance this, <hi>viz.</hi> that there was a difference amongſt thoſe of the Corporation about making an Attorny of their Court, at a Court held for the Town, that there was like to be a tumult and uproar about this matter; whereupon the Baylifs that held the Court did adjourn the Court, and commanded all perſons there to depart, and then they with the reſt that were of their party went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But the other parties on the contrary ſide, whereof <hi>Yates</hi> and the reſt that were diſfranchiſed were a part ſtayed ſtill in the Town-Hall, and ſaid, the Court was not diſſolved, and did affirm they were a Court, and did therupon make divers orders or acts of Court, and cauſed them to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Court book where all the orders uſed to be entred To this retorn many exceptions were taken, and firſt by <hi>Sergeant Twiſden, 1.</hi> That here was no ſufficient matter of fact retorned to be done by <hi>Yates</hi> and the others, to cauſe them to be disfranchiſed. 2ly. That the retorn did not ſhew, that the Cuſtoms of their Corporation did warrant them to disfranchiſe any for ſuch offences, or did ſhew that any perſon had at any time been disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed for ſuch offences, 3ly. The retorn mentions that the perſons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed had broken their oaths as Freemen of the Town, but doth not ſet forth this oath at large as it ought to be. 4ly. They do not ſhew in the retorn that they had any authority to hold that Court which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, nor before whom it was held. 5ly. It is not ſhewed in the retorn that <hi>Yates</hi> and the others were at all convented to anſwer their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo they are condemned without hearing of them, which is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. To theſe exceptions <hi>Green</hi> of Councel to maintain the retorn made this anſwer, for the firſt he ſaid, there doth appear a ſufficient fact to be done by <hi>Yates</hi> and the reſt to cauſe them to be disfranchiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> their tumultuous going into the Court, and ſtaying there after it was diſſolved, and making of orders, and entring them into the Book, and cited Sir <hi>Iames Bags</hi> caſe, that this their fact was a corrupting the orders of the Town. For the ſecond the retorn doth ſufficiently expreſs, that by their Cuſtoms they may remove perſons from their places in the Corporation for ſuch offences, for the retorn ſaith,<note place="margin">Removeable.</note> that perſons have been from time to time removeable, which is all one as if it had ſaid, they have been removed. 3ly. It is not neceſſary to ſet forth the whole oath of a Freeman, and here is as much of the oath mentioned as is needfull to ſhew that the oath was broken by them. 4ly. It is ſhewed in the retorn, that the Court was held according to their Cuſtomes, and ſo it ſhall be intended to be a good Court, and rightly held, and it needs not to be expreſſed before whom it was held. 5ly. It is expreſſed that they were convented, and that they had alſo notice of the diſſolution of the Court. <hi>Mr. Attorney General</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, Here is cauſe to disfranchiſe the parties; for here appears by their fact to be a ſetting up of government againſt government,<note place="margin">Oppoſition of government.</note> and this is corrupting of government, and done by knowing perſons that well underſtand the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Town, which makes their crimes the greater, and it is better retorned, that ſuch perſons are removeable, than to ſay they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and here is more than an opinion of one of the parties againſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinon of the others, for they have reduced their opinion into an Act to diſturb the government. Mr. Recorder of <hi>London</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, that here is a fact done to eradicate the whole government of the Town, for doing whereof the parties juſtly deſerve to be disfranchiſed, and their entring of orders into the Regiſter-book is a corrupting of the Cuſtoms of the Town, and tends to the ſubverſion of the Corporation, and he cited <hi>28 H. S. Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:49377:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>caſe in <hi>Dyer. Alleyn</hi> on the ſame ſide, Here is ſufficient cauſe ſhewed in the retorn to turn the parties out of their offices, unto which they pray to be reſtored if there ſhould not appear ſufficient matter to disfranchiſe them. <hi>Roll</hi> who when this caſe was firſt moved was <hi>chief Iuſtice</hi> ſaid, here is one <hi>Groves</hi> that prays to be reſtored, concerning whom the retorn ſhews no cauſe at all why he was removed,<note place="margin">No cauſe of disfranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but only that he was endicted of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, which is not a ſufficient cauſe, for he may be endicted falſely, and it doth not appear that any thing hath been as yet done upon the: Endictment, and yet they allege this for cauſe why they will not reſtore him, and if you have no cauſe to remove him, then he is unjuſtly removed, and ought to be reſtored, and this cauſe you have ſhewed, ſuch as it is, was after that he was removed, and ſo could be no cauſe of his removal. But for the reſt there is no queſtion but that here is a high contempt, and juſt cauſe to disfranchiſe the parties, for here is more than an opinion, as hath been urged for them, for there is an Act of a high nature tending to evert all government in hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the proceedings of Iuſtice, and the profit and wellfare of the Town, and a greater offence of this nature cannot be imagined, and therefore for the matter there is cauſe to disfranchiſe them. But the queſtion is, whether the retorn be good, and as to that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it not neceſſary to ſet forth the whole Oath, or to aver the ſwearing of the Attorney. But the retorn ought to have been, that by their Cuſtome they have uſed to remove perſons for ſuch offences,<note place="margin">Have uſed to remove.</note> and not to ſay they are removeable, and of this I doubt and will adviſe. At another day <hi>Latch</hi> of Councel for <hi>Yates</hi> urged that the retorn was not good, for they have not ſhewn any Act done to remove any perſon for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors, according to the cuſtom, as they have alleged it; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſays only that ſuch parties have been removable, and this is only a poſsibility of an act, and it appears not how they are removable,<note place="margin">Poſsibility of an Act.</note> either by their Cuſtom, or by their Charter, and conſequently here is no ground for their removal returned, <hi>Paſch. 33 Eliz. C. B.</hi> a potential Cuſtom returned is not good,<note place="margin">Potential cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome not good.</note> 
                  <hi>poſſit &amp; potuiſlet</hi> adjudged not good in Sir <hi>William Hattons</hi> caſe, and <hi>21 Iac. uſus fuit</hi> held naught. And as to the Objection that it is not neceſſary to return their power to remove, becauſe it is a thing incident unto their Corporation, I anſwer they have returned a power, but have not made it good by the return. <hi>Mag Chart. 25.</hi> and to the Objection that a return needeth not to be ſo formal as a pleading, and that therefore if their power do appear upon the whole return it is good enough, I anſwer, that they have failed in the very matter of their preſcription, and not in the form only, and they muſt certifie a good cauſe of their removal, that the Court may judge of it; and as to that which is objected, that their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a very antient Charter, and therefore cannot be pleaded, I anſwer,<note place="margin">Charter plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and not given in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> that they may give it in evidence, and alſo a Charter made time out of mind may be pleaded as an old deed may, although you cannot plead that it was made time out of mind. <hi>Serjeant Twiſden</hi> on the ſame ſide, All cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms ought to be alleged in <hi>facto, 9 Car. Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Bagnals</hi> caſe, <hi>Licitum fuit</hi> for a <hi>Londoner</hi> to uſe any trade by the cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> adjudged to be ill pleaded, and though it may be good in an evidence, yet it is not good in a return. <hi>Alleyn</hi> on the other ſide ſaid, that the return is good in the returning of the cuſtom, though it would have been ill in the pleading,<note place="margin">Pleading. Retorn.</note> which is ſtricter than a return need to be, and here is matter enough return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove the parties, and the whole cuſtoms need not to be returned, and the informality of the return ſhall not make it ill, for this Court is to judge of the matter of fact returned, and ſo is <hi>Giles Bags</hi> and <hi>Wagoners</hi> caſe, and they have returned a cuſtom to remove, and by conſequence ſome have been removed, or elſe the return is falſe, which is not to be preſumed. <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
                  <pb n="480" facs="tcp:49377:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>Every cuſtom is preſumed by the Law to have a lawfull beginning, and ſhall be intended many times to be by antient Charter, namely, for ſuch things as are not to be claimed without a Charter, but if they may be claimed without a Charter it ſhall be intended otherwiſe.<note place="margin">Antient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> An antient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth not loſe its force by not being confirmed in <hi>Eyre,</hi> as <hi>Latch</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>24 H. 6.</hi> and there may be a preſcription for things which have never been acted, if it began by Charter, <hi>22 E. 4. f. 9. Green</hi> on the ſame ſide The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words of the retorn do enforce that perſons have béen removed. <hi>Glyn chief Iuſtice,</hi> I have no books delivered me in this caſe; And this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was moved the laſt Term, and it is very doubtfull to me, and my Lord <hi>Roll</hi> would not deliver his opinion, I could wiſh the buſineſs might be compoſed for the peace of the Corporation. To ſay that the lands have been demiſed and demiſable, the words ſhall be taken diſtributive. But me ſeems here is no matter of fact returned for removing of any. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day the caſe was ſpoken to again, and againſt the return it was except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as formerly,<note place="margin">Preſcription in fieri.</note> that the Town had not by the return intitled themſelves to any power to remove the parties, for here is a preſcription only in <hi>fieri</hi> and not <hi>in facto</hi> returned, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch perſons have been accuſtomed to be removable, and it doth not ſay they have béen removed, and theſe caſes, <hi>viz, 20 E. 4.</hi> and <hi>Mich. 7 Car. Flower,</hi> caſe, and <hi>Mich. 9 Car. Fletcher</hi> and <hi>Bagſhaws</hi> caſe, and <hi>Skipwiths</hi> caſe, <hi>25 Eliz. C. B.</hi> were cited by <hi>Wild</hi> on Councel for <hi>Yates. Windham</hi> on the other ſide as formerly diſtinguiſhed betwixt a pleading, and a return, which needs not be ſo formal as a plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ſhall be taken good to a common intent, and ſaid that <hi>Wagoners</hi> caſe, which was as this is, was adjudged to be well upon good advice, and the ſubſtance of the preſcription is well ſet forth in the return, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality is not to be much ſtood upon,<note place="margin">Subſtance.</note> or regarded. <hi>Alleyn</hi> on the ſame ſide ſaid, that the rule in <hi>Wagoners</hi> caſe comes home to this. <hi>Glyn chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> There is an Action upon the caſe brought by <hi>Yates</hi> for this matter, and if it be found for him we will reſtore him, be the return as it will. Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is the main hinge upon which all disfranchiſements do move, and if that be not well alleged, it will be hard for the disfranchiſement. <hi>Try your cauſe this Term, otherwiſe we will deliver our opinions upon the return.</hi> At a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother bay the Court was moved for their opinion upon the return, by <hi>Yates</hi> his Councel, whether it was good or not. Wherupon <hi>Glyn chief Iuſt.</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, It were good you would agree as the Court hath adviſed; But ſince you will not we will give our judgement, for the cauſe hath depended long. And firſt I conceive that here is good cauſe to disfranchiſe the parties for entring of orders made by a pretended Court,<note place="margin">Cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which in truth was no Court, for their entry of ſuch orders is very prejudicial to the corporation, and is to the ill example of others, to diſturb the government. But Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is the main cauſe of disfranchiſing any perſon, for by the disfranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the party loſes his freehold, which is no ſmall loſs, and therefore not to be put in practice but upon very good warrant; &amp; yet in ſome caſes for the advancement of government one may be put out of his freehold without a legal procéeding againſt the party, as Sir <hi>Iames Bags</hi> caſe is. But there muſt be a Cuſtom or a Statute to warrant it. But here appears no ſuch Cuſtom upon the return, for the return is that for ſuch offences the parties have uſed to be removable and diſchargeable, which is meerly imaginary, and a thing in <hi>fieri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Thing in fieri not in facto.</note> and not <hi>in facto,</hi> or in uſage, and ſo it is as a dead thing in the womb which never had birth, for you have not ſhewed that it was at any time put in practice, or have made any direct affirmance of the Cuſtom, as all Cuſtoms uſe to be pleaded. All Cuſtoms imply two things,<note place="margin">Poſſibility and uſe.</note> to wit, a thing poſsible to be done, and that the thing hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been done, and ſo are all our pleadings, and the return ought to
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:49377:251" rendition="simple:additions"/>have in it certainty enough to inform the Court of the maſter returned, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not required they ſhould be ſo preciſe as pleadings ought to be,<note place="margin">Return ſhould be certain.</note> for both the Court and the party muſt abide by the return, and it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as true. In <hi>Wagoners</hi> caſe cited, It was touched whether the Cuſtom there was well alleged, and concerning the Cuſtoms of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> alſo, which do differ from other cuſtoms, they being confirmed by Statute, and there they allege a ſpecial act of Common Councel by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and a Statute alſo to enable them to do as they did. I have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red well of the return, and I hold the return to be naught,<note place="margin">Ill return.</note> and therefore <hi>let him be reſtored. Ask Iuſtice</hi> concurred in opinion.
